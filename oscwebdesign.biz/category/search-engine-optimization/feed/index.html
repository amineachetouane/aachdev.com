										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The last time you Googled a local business, did you notice the map and local results that showed up first? That’s called the “snack pack” and it’s unique to local searches.</p>



<p>If you’re a local business, you may be wondering how to show up in the snack pack or how to rank higher than you already do. Read on to learn how to optimize for better local SEO.</p>



<h2 id="h-1-claim-your-local-listing"><strong>1. Claim your local listing.</strong></h2>



<p>Before you rank higher in local search, you have to show up there. First things first, claim your listing (if you haven’t already) in Google My Business. GMB controls the backend of Google local listings.</p>



<p><a href="https://business.google.com/create?hl=en&amp;gmbsrc=ww-ww-z-z-al-gmb-s-z-l~mbi-d">Start by going here</a> and following the steps to search for your business and claim the listing. You’ll be offered multiple options for claiming your listing (including receiving a letter and entering the code, receiving a phone call at your business address, and potentially more options, depending on your business).</p>



<h2 id="h-2-complete-your-listing"><strong>2. Complete your listing.</strong></h2>



<p>One of the best things you can do for your local search visibility is to fill out your Google My Business account in its entirety. While some areas may not apply for you (like Products, if you’re a service-based company), it’s critical to fill out as much information as possible. Keep keywords and phrases in mind as you fill out certain areas like Categories, as well.</p>



<p>If you’re curious, the biggest four areas for the most impact on your local SEO in Google My Business are:</p>



<ol><li>Business Name</li><li>Categories</li><li>Website</li><li>And&#8230;<br></li></ol>



<h2 id="h-3-get-positive-reviews"><strong>3. Get positive reviews.</strong></h2>



<p>Google uses the number and star ratings of reviews in the snack pack algorithm. In other words, reviews are weighed heavily when it comes to ranking local listings.</p>



<p>Since unhappy customers are far more likely to leave reviews than happy customers, it’s vital that you reach out to and remind your happy customers about your business and their positive experience.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Make it simple for customers to leave a review by including a link directly to your Google Maps profile review section. (You can find this in your Google My Business account.) Thank your customers for their loyalty and &#8211; if it makes sense for your business &#8211; offer incentives for leaving a review like a percentage off their next purchase.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img width="388" height="211" src="https://oscwebdesign.biz/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/image-1.png" alt="" class="wp-image-4243" srcset="https://oscwebdesign.biz/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/image-1.png 388w, https://oscwebdesign.biz/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/image-1-300x163.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 388px) 100vw, 388px" /></figure></div>



<h2 id="h-4-respond-to-your-reviews"><strong>4. Respond to your reviews.</strong></h2>



<p>Using Google My Business, you have the ability to flag reviews as inappropriate, as well as respond publicly. While it may be your gut reaction to delete a negative review, we’ve actually seen better results from clients who <em>respond</em> to a negative review publicly, rather than deleting it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>By all means, go ahead and flag an inappropriate or profane review, but pause when it comes to a justified negative review. This is your chance to show your company’s true character: express your sympathy for the customer’s poor experience and offer a solution to solve their problem. For some businesses, this might be an apology, while for others it may be a discount code or percentage off their next product purchase.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="666" height="297" src="https://oscwebdesign.biz/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/image.png" alt="" class="wp-image-4242" srcset="https://oscwebdesign.biz/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/image.png 666w, https://oscwebdesign.biz/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/image-300x134.png 300w, https://oscwebdesign.biz/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/image-600x268.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 666px) 100vw, 666px" /></figure></div>



<h2 id="h-5-make-regular-updates-to-your-gmb-account"><strong>5. Make regular updates to your GMB account.</strong></h2>



<p>Google My Business accounts have become more like social media accounts. With them, you’re able to make post updates regularly, so make sure you’re doing so!</p>



<p>Status updates are similar to Facebook in that they’ll include a post or message, as well as a unique option to show an offer, “what’s new” item, or event; and even a call-to-action button. Suffice it to say: your local business is definitely missing out if you aren’t making regular updates here!&nbsp;</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="460" height="370" src="https://oscwebdesign.biz/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/image-2.png" alt="" class="wp-image-4244" srcset="https://oscwebdesign.biz/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/image-2.png 460w, https://oscwebdesign.biz/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/image-2-300x241.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 460px) 100vw, 460px" /></figure></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As a local restaurant, Search Engine Optimization is a huge key for your success. With search engines often providing your first impression to potential customers, it’s no longer negotiable whether your website needs to appear at the top of search engines.</p>



<p>Here are 10 ways to optimize your restaurant website for better SEO.</p>



<h2><strong>1. Incorporate your keywords.</strong></h2>



<p>One of the most powerful ways to optimize your website is to incorporate the keywords your customers are searching for within your copy; as well as your page titles, meta-descriptions, headers, navigation, and links. Remember to include location-based keywords along with “places to eat,” “diner” or “restaurant,” etc.</p>



<h2><strong>2. Create quality content.</strong></h2>



<p>Create ongoing content on your website with a blog, a podcast, or videos &#8211; whatever works best for your restaurant &#8211; and get creative! Post recipes your customers will love, tutorials on cooking the perfect meal, or podcasting tips for healthy eating.</p>



<h2><strong>3. Don’t forget your address and phone number.</strong></h2>



<p>A seemingly easy mistake to make, be sure to include your address and phone number on the contact page of your site, along with the footer of each page. This will help communicate your location to the search engines, along with your contact information for your customers.</p>



<h2><strong>4. Make sure your website is mobile friendly.</strong></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="367" src="https://oscwebdesign.biz/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/website-vs-app-online-restaurant-orders-1024x367.jpg" alt="Ordering online, website vs app design" class="wp-image-3576" srcset="https://oscwebdesign.biz/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/website-vs-app-online-restaurant-orders-1024x367.jpg 1024w, https://oscwebdesign.biz/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/website-vs-app-online-restaurant-orders-300x108.jpg 300w, https://oscwebdesign.biz/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/website-vs-app-online-restaurant-orders-768x275.jpg 768w, https://oscwebdesign.biz/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/website-vs-app-online-restaurant-orders-600x215.jpg 600w, https://oscwebdesign.biz/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/website-vs-app-online-restaurant-orders.jpg 1330w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Nothing is more frustrating for restaurant goers than trying to check out the menu, get a reservation, or simply click on your phone number to call on their mobile device than going to a website that isn’t mobile friendly (or responsive).</p>



<h2><strong>5. Create a search engine friendly menu.</strong></h2>



<p>One of the most visited pages on your restaurant site is undoubtedly your menu page. It’s valuable to create a search engine friendly page &#8211; with readable text &#8211; rather than uploading a PDF.</p>



<h2><strong>6. Focus on user experience.</strong></h2>



<p>At the end of the day, great website user experience drives more customers to your restaurant and search engines reward incredible user experience. Build your site to put the user first, no matter what.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="768" height="411" src="https://oscwebdesign.biz/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/good-user-experience-restaurant.jpg" alt="Good user experiences at your restaurant and with website" class="wp-image-3615" srcset="https://oscwebdesign.biz/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/good-user-experience-restaurant.jpg 768w, https://oscwebdesign.biz/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/good-user-experience-restaurant-300x161.jpg 300w, https://oscwebdesign.biz/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/good-user-experience-restaurant-600x321.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></figure>



<h2><strong>7. Ensure your local listings are up-to-date.</strong></h2>



<p>Update your Google My Business, Facebook, OpenTable, and other local directory pages so that it has accurate information about your hours, menu, and any videos, photos, and so on.</p>



<h2><strong>8. Acquire more positive local reviews.&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>The more positive local reviews you have, the better you’ll rank within local search. Perform regular monitoring of your reviews to determine if any warrant a response or even a share on your website or social media.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="768" height="411" src="https://oscwebdesign.biz/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/positive-local-reviews-resturant-website.jpg" alt="Get positive restaurant local reviews" class="wp-image-3616" srcset="https://oscwebdesign.biz/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/positive-local-reviews-resturant-website.jpg 768w, https://oscwebdesign.biz/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/positive-local-reviews-resturant-website-300x161.jpg 300w, https://oscwebdesign.biz/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/positive-local-reviews-resturant-website-600x321.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></figure>



<h2><strong>9. Make the site secure.</strong></h2>



<p>Whether or not you sell anything on your website, it’s crucial that you keep it secure with an SSL certificate (or HTTPS address). Search engines give more value to those sites with an HTTPS address versus HTTP.</p>



<h2><strong>10. Don’t ignore the data.</strong></h2>



<p>Make sure you have analytical data from your website to learn how people are finding you and how they interact with your site. Google Analytics and Google Search Console are great (free) tools to do just that!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>By now, we all know the best long term strategy for building links is to create quality &#8220;share-worthy&#8221; content. But realistically when you&#8217;re first starting out, you may not have the necessary time or resources. The idea of defining a target audience, keywords, and a content strategy can understandably overwhelm most fledgling entrepreneurs.</p>



<p>Isn&#8217;t there an easier way to get started? Yes! Get your SEO ball rolling with the following 5 super easy ways to build your website&#8217;s first links.</p>



<h2>1. Ask a friend.</h2>



<p>What are friends for besides some trusty link building? While unrelated reciprocal link exchanges are big no-no&#8217;s in Google&#8217;s eyes, it&#8217;s perfectly fine to link to a friend&#8217;s website or article when relevant.</p>



<p>For example, imagine you own a landscaping company. Your friend&#8217;s excavation website would be a very relevant place to recommend your landscaping services and vis-versa.</p>



<h2>2. Find who&#8217;s already talking about you.</h2>



<p>If other websites are referring to you, your business, or your content already, you have a prime opportunity to acquire precious link juice. This route is perhaps the very easiest one for building your first links because these sources should really be linking to you in the first place.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s as straightforward as Googling yourself. If your brand name often becomes confused with other brands in search results, you should enter your company&#8217;s name plus a term associated with it. For example, &#8216;AACHDEV + SEO&#8217;.</p>



<p>Items you&#8217;ll want to search:</p>



<ul><li>Company Name</li><li>Employee Names (if too many unrelated results, try &#8216;Employee Name + Company Name or Related Term&#8217;)</li><li>Owner&#8217;s Name</li><li>Alternate Company Names (like &#8216;OSC&#8217; instead of &#8216;AACHDEV&#8217;)</li></ul>



<p>So how do you get links added after finding the opportunities? You guessed it: ask.</p>



<h2>3. Join a local networking group.</h2>



<p>Take your online approach offline. Meetups and organizations like <a href="https://oscwebdesign.biz/think-locals-8th-anniversary-photo-booth/">Think Local</a> allow you to reach local customers and forge valuable partnerships… Not to mention super easy links.</p>



<p>Most networking events are promoted online and list attendees on the website. We can&#8217;t emphasize enough how important it is to engage with the community – the benefits extend far beyond SEO!</p>



<h2>4. Find websites who link to your competitors.</h2>



<p>If an article lists a number of local businesses, why shouldn&#8217;t you be on that list too? Directories and comparison articles are common examples of where you might find this.</p>



<p>Tools like <a href="https://moz.com/researchtools/ose/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Moz&#8217;s Open Site Explorer</a> allow you to get a look at not only your backlinks, but your competitors too.</p>



<h2>5. Leave a detailed testimonial.</h2>



<div class="wp-block-image wp-image-3056 size-full"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="883" height="352" src="https://oscwebdesign.biz/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/easy-way-build-links.png" alt="Easy Ways to Build First Links" class="wp-image-3056" srcset="https://oscwebdesign.biz/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/easy-way-build-links.png 883w, https://oscwebdesign.biz/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/easy-way-build-links-300x120.png 300w, https://oscwebdesign.biz/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/easy-way-build-links-768x306.png 768w, https://oscwebdesign.biz/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/easy-way-build-links-600x239.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 883px) 100vw, 883px" /><figcaption>A snapshot from Maine Labpack.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Wouldn&#8217;t you love to receive stellar feedback from a customer? Turns out other business owners would too! If you use a product or service routinely that you&#8217;re happy with, send the company a testimonial. It would make for perfect content to showcase on their website (and an easy way to build your links).</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<p>That wasn&#8217;t so hard now was it? After you get the balling rolling with link building, you can begin tackling the rest of your marketing strategy.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Is it really possible to improve your website’s SEO in minutes? While search engine optimization efforts can prove complicated and time consuming, there are plenty of quick &#8211; yet effective &#8211; fixes you can make right now.</p>



<p>Open up the backend of your website and get started!</p>



<h2>Reorganize blog categories and tags.</h2>



<p>When naming blog categories keep your keyword list handy to refer to. Whenever possible, include target keywords &#8211; but only where they make sense. For example, if we hitched ‘Maine’ onto each of our blog category names, they may be closer to our target keywords but would look repetitive and spammy.</p>



<p>If you’re ever contemplating&nbsp;if you should sacrifice user-experience for SEO &#8211; always choose UX. Search engines will continue to move towards favoring websites with superior UX anyway.</p>



<h2>Install Yoast SEO.</h2>

<ul><li>Create XML sitemaps.</li><li>Improve SEO with real-time page analysis (example in image above).</li><li>Control which pages are shown in search results and which are not.</li><li>Integrate social media accounts.</li><li>Adjust page title tags and meta descriptions.</li><li>&amp; more.</li></ul>



<p>..all for free!</p>



<h2>Use proper header tags.</h2>



<p>In the following video, Matt Cutts (former Google head of webspam) minimizes the importance of header tags. While they are indeed far less important than other SEO aspects, do you really want to disregard them just because there are other websites out there with awful SEO?</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe loading="lazy" title="Does the ordering of heading tags matter?" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iR5itZlq8sk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div></figure>



<p>It’s our opinion that header tags are still worth caring about, especially with the limited number of SEO factors under our control.</p>



<p>So, how do you properly use headings? Our rule of thumb is to move in order of most important. In the example below, let’s say the larger area is most important.</p>



<p>&lt;h1&gt;Earth&lt;/h1&gt;<br>&lt;h2&gt;North America&lt;/h2&gt;<br>&lt;h3&gt;United States&lt;/h3&gt;<br>&lt;h4&gt;Maine&lt;/h4&gt;<br>&lt;h5&gt;Scarborough&lt;/h5&gt;<br>&lt;h6&gt;Highland Ave&lt;/h6&gt;</p>



<p>Whenever possible, try to include keywords in your h1 tags at the least.</p>



<h2>Improve your URLs.</h2>



<p>It should come as no surprise that yes; search engines pay attention to URLs as well. Remove all unnecessary words from URLs, such as “stop” words like and, if, on, etc. Let the focus be on important keywords that are the main focus of the page.</p>



<h2>Rewrite title tags and meta descriptions.</h2>



<p>Optimized title tags and meta descriptions are not only huge for SEO, these serve as the preview of pages in search engine results. Stand out from competitors and improve click-through-rate by writing enticing call-to-actions like:</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><a href="https://oscwebdesign.biz/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/OSC-Web-Design-title-and-meta-tag-for-SEO.png"><img src="https://oscwebdesign.biz/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/OSC-Web-Design-title-and-meta-tag-for-SEO-1024x165.png" alt="Quick SEO fix: title and meta tags." class="wp-image-4772"/></a></figure></div>



<p>Don’t forget to use keywords!</p>



<h2>Go through your image alt tags.</h2>



<p>If you’ve been neglecting your image alt tags, these are an easy SEO 5 minute fix. Doing this will make your images accessible for both users with visual impairments as well as search engines. It’s important to remember that search engines can’t read images, so they look to your alt tags to determine what images are about.</p>



<h2>Use nofollow tags.</h2>



<p>If you use external links to websites you aren’t necessarily “recommending”, it’s smart to make them <a href="https://oscwebdesign.biz/use-nofollow-links/">nofollow links</a>. This tells search engines that you aren’t vouching for the credibility of said links, and hopefully (search engine bots don’t always listen) they will continue crawling your page instead of following the link. Conserve that precious link juice!</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<p>There you have it: 5 minute fixes for improving your website’s SEO. Remember, sometimes it’s the little things that can make all the difference. Combine quick fixes with long term solutions for an SEO strategy that will get you ranking above the rest.</p>The post <a href="https://oscwebdesign.biz/5-minute-fix-improve-websites-seo-minutes/">5 Minute Fix: Improve Your Website’s SEO in Minutes</a> appeared first on <a href="https://oscwebdesign.biz">AACHDEV</a>.]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What does capital punishment and Google’s search algorithm have in common? They both have horrid penalties that you should avoid at all costs. If you find yourself in the unfortunate position of dealing with a Google penalty, look on the bright side: with a little luck and the right steps, both you and your website will make it out alive.</p>
<h2>Zero in on the Penalty</h2>
<p>There are two kinds of Google penalties: manual action and an algorithmic penalty.</p>
<p>A manual action penalty takes place when a staff member of Google identifies a web page as spam, and punishes webmasters by hurting it’s rank or removing it from search engine results.</p>
<p>An algorithmic penalty occurs when Google updates their algorithm, and certain websites are more inline with Google’s idea of what makes a website trustworthy and useful to searchers. The remaining websites are in turn, outranked.</p>
<h3>Manual Action Penalty</h3>
<p>If you’ve been hit by this penalty, we have some good news and some bad news. The good news is that there’s not much guessing involved. Google will actually send you a message in <a href="https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/" rel="nofollow">Google Webmaster Tools</a> (a must-have if you own a website) to notify you of the manual action.</p>
<p>The bad news is that this is a difficult one to overcome. If they’ve given your website this penalty, it means they’ve detected you’ve been participating in banned practices outlined in their <a href="https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/35769?hl=en" rel="nofollow">Webmaster Guidelines</a>.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yFxNda5Z4eE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<h3>Algorithmic Penalty</h3>
<p>An algorithmic penalty isn’t technically a penalty at all. As Google continues to make changes to promote quality in search results, web pages that don’t follow along with their vision of quality will be negatively affected.</p>
<p>Since none of us can read Google’s mind, unfortunately their changes sometimes leave innocent businesses scrambling.</p>
<h2>What to Do If You’ve Been Penalized</h2>
<p>The If you fall into the more common (and preferable) situation and suffer from an algorithmic penalty, start by checking <a href="https://moz.com/google-algorithm-change" rel="nofollow">Moz’s Google Algorithm Change History</a>.</p>
<p><strong>STEP 1:</strong> Open up Google Analytics and compare your traffic drop to Moz’s change history. Keep in mind that effects are not always instant, so your website could be experiencing symptoms from an earlier change.</p>
<p><strong>STEP 2:</strong> Once you think you have an idea of which change is the culprit, do some research. What have others speculated is the cause? Has Google given any insight?</p>
<p><strong>STEP 3:</strong> If you’ve worked with an SEO firm in the past, it’s time to call them up. It’s possible they were using <a href="https://oscwebdesign.biz/warning-signs-dishonest-seo-company/">sketchy tactics</a> that are now affecting all of their clients, or they can at least give you some advice.</p>
<p><strong>STEP 4:</strong> How picky have you been when linking to external websites? Do you know who’s been linking to you? Spammy websites could be linking to yours without your knowledge. Check your backlinks with <a href="https://moz.com/researchtools/ose" rel="nofollow">Moz’s Open Site Explorer</a> and <a href="https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/2648487?hl=en" rel="nofollow">disavow</a> any spammy ones.</p>
<p><a href="https://oscwebdesign.biz/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Screen-Shot-2017-04-04-at-2.50.56-PM.png"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-4465 size-large" src="https://oscwebdesign.biz/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Screen-Shot-2017-04-04-at-2.50.56-PM-1024x606.png" alt="Check backlinks to prevent Google penalty" width="1024" height="606" /></a></p>
<p><strong>STEP 5:</strong> If you’ve looked at your backlinks and you&#8217;re free from spam, you have an internal problem. You could be guilty of a long-time bad practice like <a href="https://oscwebdesign.biz/keywords-never-target-rank/">keyword stuffing</a> or duplicate content. It’s not uncommon for website owners to try saving on time by copying content from one of their existing websites to a new one.</p>
<p><strong>STEP 6:</strong> How is your website structured? Google has been placing an increasing emphasis on user-experience, in particular mobile-friendliness. If your web design isn’t <a href="https://oscwebdesign.biz/check-website-non-responsive-3-things-costs/">responsive on all devices</a> it’s time to get to it!</p>
<h2>Stay Updated on Algorithm Changes</h2>
<p>Since much of Google’s algorithm activity is cloaked in secrecy, no source exists with the ability to broadcast every single change. Luckily, you can usually detect big changes from all the website chatter that ensues.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://mozcast.com/" rel="nofollow">MozCast</a>: A fun tool by Moz that reports on any Google Algorithm turbulence.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://oscwebdesign.biz/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Screen-Shot-2017-04-04-at-12.39.10-PM.png"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-4466 size-large" src="https://oscwebdesign.biz/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Screen-Shot-2017-04-04-at-12.39.10-PM-1024x564.png" alt="Google Algorithm changes and penalties check" width="1024" height="564" /></a></p>
<ul>

<li><a href="https://webmasters.googleblog.com/" rel="nofollow">Google Webmaster Blog</a>: If you want to hear it right from the horse’s mouth, follow the official Google Webmaster Central Blog.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>How’s it looking for the future of your website? Are you willing to put in the work to get ranking again, or are you going to abandon your domain and make a last meal request?</p>The post <a href="https://oscwebdesign.biz/help-website-hit-google-penalty/">Help!

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>High-speed internet is an ongoing service which requires recurring payments &#8211; you get that. You even understand why your business has to pay to replenish office supplies on an ongoing basis.</p>
<p>But there’s one thing you can’t come to terms with.. Why is <a href="https://oscwebdesign.biz/seo-2017-beginners-guide-small-businesses/">search engine optimization</a> an ongoing process?!</p>
<p>In a time where it seems everyone’s trying to squeeze recurring payments out of customers, for some services, it really does makes sense. Here are 4 reasons why search engine optimization is in fact an ongoing process.</p>
<h2>1. Search engine algorithm changes.</h2>
<p>Did you know that Google is estimated to make from <a href="https://moz.com/google-algorithm-change" rel="nofollow">500-600 changes</a> to their search engine algorithm.. Per year?</p>
<p>This algorithm is what determines which website pages rank for different queries and in what order. While many of these changes go unnoticed by webmasters, some are a bit more dramatic.</p>
<p>For example, in 2015 Google announced that they would increase the importance of mobile friendliness in the algorithm:</p>
<p>[su_quote]Starting April 21, we will be expanding our use of mobile-friendliness as a ranking signal. This change will affect mobile searches in all languages worldwide and will have a significant impact in our search results. Consequently, users will find it easier to get relevant, high quality search results that are optimized for their devices.[/su_quote]</p>
<p>In January of 2017 Google cracked down on “intrusive interstitials” with a penalty to combat aggressive website pop-ups.</p>
<p>Without ongoing search engine optimization, websites risk being punished by new search engine penalties and falling behind on algorithm changes.</p>
<h2>2. New competition.</h2>
<p>It doesn’t matter what industry you’re in &#8211; there’s constantly new competition popping up across the web. One day you may be ranking quite well for a <a href="https://oscwebdesign.biz/6-places-website-keywords/">keyword</a>, and the following a competitor has surpassed you with a highly trafficked piece of content.</p>
<p>If a new competitor has emerged or a larger company has decided to target your keyword, your business faces a decision: attempt to squash them or move on to a new keyword.</p>
<p>The sooner you find out, the better, as it’d be regrettable to waste your resources on a lost cause.</p>
<h2>3. The shifting market.</h2>
<p>Are you going to wait to learn about new market shifts through the grapevine? You can listen to trend speculations all you want, what real people are searching on the internet shows where your industry is heading.</p>
<p>For example, imagine you run a financial investing company. If you’re receiving reports that a keyword like ‘financial advisor app’ is being used far more in search queries than ‘financial advisor’, it may be time to look up an experienced mobile app developer.</p>
<h2>4. <a href="https://oscwebdesign.biz/keyword-optimization-dead-topical-authority/">Topical authority</a>.</h2>
<p>It’s no longer effective to use the same keyword in a few blog posts. Search engines favor websites that cover multiple topics in-depth.</p>
<p>This means that in order for your website to rank in search engines, you should approach keyword optimization like this:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">1. Conduct keyword research.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 90px;">a. Find broad keywords you want to rank for (i.e. financial planning, retirement planning).</p>
<p style="padding-left: 90px;">b. Narrow in on more specific keywords within the broad keyword categories (i.e. where to find a financial investor, retirement investment account).</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">2. Create multiple blog posts to target each specific keyword.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">3. Promote blog posts on social media.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">4. Measure results.</p>
<hr />
<p>Effective search engine optimization always involves ongoing efforts. Unfortunately, a yearly keyword audit just don’t cut it anymore. With the right approach and patience, you’ll find that the rewards will be great for your business: both online and off.</p>The post <a href="https://oscwebdesign.biz/search-engine-optimization-ongoing-process/">4 Reasons Why Search Engine Optimization is an Ongoing Process</a> appeared first on <a href="https://oscwebdesign.biz">AACHDEV</a>.]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Link building is crucial to any <a href="https://oscwebdesign.biz/seo-2017-beginners-guide-small-businesses/">SEO strategy</a>.. And can also serve as a perpetual source of frustration. The good ones can’t be bought, they must be earned. If you’re just now wondering how to get links, luckily the answer isn’t one that requires years of study.</p>
<p>Continue reading to learn 4 link building steps (for beginners!).</p>
<p>[su_box title=&#8221;Attention! Remember that not all links are good links.&#8221;]It’s important to know that not all links are good for increasing your website’s rank in search engines. Links from spammy websites can actually hurt your credibility in search engines &#8211; the concept of trustworthiness is a significant ranking factor in Google’s search engine algorithm. We’ll explain later how to check a link’s trustworthiness.[/su_box]</p>
<h2>Step 1: Find the links.</h2>
<p>Before you can work on how to get links, you need to <em>find</em> links. You already know that not all links are good links, so you can’t just shoot for a link from any old website.</p>
<p>Besides trustworthiness, you should only work on procuring links from <strong>related websites</strong>. This can be done by conducting a search in Google and also by stealing, er, getting *inspiration* from your competitors.</p>
<p>No worries, “stealing” backlinks is completely legal.</p>
<p>Check out who’s linking to your competitors with<a href="https://moz.com/researchtools/ose/" rel="nofollow">Moz’s Open Site Explorer</a>. Just type in their URL and voilà &#8211; you have a list of linking pages.</p>
<p>If you’ve found a particular article you would like to be included in, be sure to check that their links don’t include a nofollow tag. While a nofollow link still may send human traffic to your website, it will not pass “link juice” or any direct SEO benefits.</p>
<h2>Step 2: Get organized.</h2>
<p>Just like you should have an <a href="https://oscwebdesign.biz/3-tips-creating-successful-content-editorial-calendar/">editorial calendar</a> to organize your marketing efforts, you should have a document to organize your link building efforts. The earlier you do this, the less headaches you’ll suffer from down the road.</p>
<p>Create your own spreadsheet or use <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1I_1G6-Kior3z8g8ZmLk2TDfTEVX1vKRNJJKgC3Rrtv0/pubhtml?widget=true&amp;amp;headers=false" rel="nofollow">ours</a> for free. Simply open the link, click <strong>File</strong> and <strong>Make a copy</strong>.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" src="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1I_1G6-Kior3z8g8ZmLk2TDfTEVX1vKRNJJKgC3Rrtv0/pubhtml?widget=true&amp;headers=false" width="1024" height="400"></iframe></p>
<p>Our spreadsheet has a number of column headers, some are pretty self-explanatory. A few that may not be:</p>
<ul>
<li>‘Likelihood to earn’ and ‘priority’ are rough estimates to make yourself.</li>
<li>‘Domain authority and ‘spam score’ are metrics taken from <a href="https://moz.com/products/pro/seo-toolbar" rel="nofollow">Moz’s MozBar</a>. This toolbar helps you to determine how powerful a website is as well as its trustworthiness.</li>
</ul>
<p>[su_spoiler title=&#8221;</p>
<h3>How to check a link’s trustworthiness with the MozBar (click to expand)</h3>
<p>&#8221; icon=&#8221;plus&#8221;]</p>
<p>To determine whether a website is trustworthy, you can download <a href="https://moz.com/products/pro/seo-toolbar" rel="nofollow">Moz’s free SEO toolbar</a> which automatically calculates a “spam score”, “DA” (domain authority), “PA” (page authority) and other information.</p>
<p>..No, we’re not affiliated with Moz in any way, we just find them to be a great resource.</p>
<p>[su_frame align=&#8221;center&#8221;]<a href="https://oscwebdesign.biz/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/link-building-moz-bar.png"><img loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-4270 aligncenter" src="https://oscwebdesign.biz/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/link-building-moz-bar-1024x40.png" alt="How to Get Links" width="1024" height="40" /></a>[/su_frame]</p>
<p>The MozBar has over 380,000 installs and is one of our go-to SEO tools here at OSC. You don’t have to know all the nitty-gritty details of ranking metrics to use it. Here’s all you need to know to start..</p>
<ul>
<li>PA (page authority): 100-point scale, predicts how well a specific page will rank in search engines.</li>
<li>DA (domain authority): 100-point scale, predicts how well a website overall will rank in search engines.</li>
<li>Spam score: 17-point scale, the lower the number the more trustworthy a site is.</li>
</ul>
<p>So basically, the higher the number the better for PA and DA, and the reverse is true for spam score. When weighing the risks of procuring links from a particular website, the spam score is what you should pay most attention to.</p>
<p><figure id="attachment_4271" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-4271" style="width: 720px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://oscwebdesign.biz/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/spam-score-links.png"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-4271 size-full" src="https://oscwebdesign.biz/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/spam-score-links.png" alt="Link Building Tips" width="720" height="206" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-4271" class="wp-caption-text">From Moz’s guide to its spam score.</figcaption></figure></p>
<p>[/su_spoiler]</p>
<h2>Step 3: Produce quality content to get links.</h2>
<p>Let’s be honest. There’s no magical shortcut to procuring links. If you find someone who claims there is, you should be very worried.</p>
<p>[ctt template=&#8221;1&#8243; link=&#8221;3s1qW&#8221; via=&#8221;no&#8221; ]“Nothing worth having comes easy: 1 high-quality link is worth a million poor ones.&#8221; #linkbuilding #seo @osc_webdesign[/ctt]</p>
<p>Just like how not all links are good links, not all link building methods are good either. “<a href="https://oscwebdesign.biz/warning-signs-dishonest-seo-company/">Black-hat SEO</a>” is a very real thing and is as bad as it sounds.</p>
<h3>Content</h3>
<p>The best way to get links is to focus on publishing content to your website that others will want to link to. Maintaining a blog that answers your audience’s questions is crucial. If you focus on topics that haven’t been answered a million times already, your chances of being linked to increase.</p>
<p>Types of content that attract the most links:</p>
<ul>
<li>Infographics</li>
<li>List posts (<a href="https://oscwebdesign.biz/web-design/features-best-modern-web-design/">7 Features of the Best Modern Web Design</a> etc.)</li>
<li>Article on an industry influencer</li>
<li>Thorough guides (<a href="https://oscwebdesign.biz/seo-2017-beginners-guide-small-businesses/">SEO in 2017: The Ultimate Beginner’s Guide for Small Businesses</a> etc.)</li>
<li>Statistics</li>
<li>Interviews</li>
<li>Guest blogging</li>
</ul>
<h3>Sharing Your Content</h3>
<p>If you want your content to be discovered, you need to make an effort. Create <a href="https://oscwebdesign.biz/get-started-social-media-small-business/">social media</a> accounts for your brand on different social media platforms. Share your new articles on there. It may take a while, but the goal is for the right person to read your content and include it on their own website or blog as a resource.</p>
<h2>Step 4: Get a little more aggressive.</h2>
<p>After you’ve found which websites you want to get links from, you can take a more hands-on approach by reaching out to them directly.</p>
<p>For example, you’ve found an article titled ‘10 Local Shops to Visit on Your Next Trip to Maine’.</p>
<p>Sadly, they neglected to mention your shop. Instead of sulking about it, you can email the author of the article something like this:</p>
<p>[su_quote]</p>
<p>Dear [Author],</p>
<p>As a long-time Maine resident, I really enjoyed reading the suggestions in your article ‘10 Local Shops to Visit on Your Next Trip to Maine’. There were a few shops in there I hadn’t heard of before!</p>
<p>Perhaps you’ll have a chance in the near future to visit my shop The Bee’s Knees (link) located on Main St. in Freeport, Maine. Many consider it a staple of this area and I think your readers would love it too.</p>
<p>Thanks for a great read!</p>

<p>This approach is more of a business decision. If you head this route, you risk becoming known as the business that emails people for links. While most people can’t blame you, it <em>can</em> sometimes seem a bit desperate.</p>
<p>You must also use caution when heading in this direction. If you participate in a link scheme that’s in violation with <a href="https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/66356?hl=en" rel="nofollow">Google’s quality guidelines</a>, your website could be penalized or even banned from search engine results.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>To search engine optimization gurus, the use of nofollow links is pretty old news. Nonetheless, nofollow links still serve a purpose and are important for working towards a higher rank in search engines like Google.</p>



<p>If you have yet to learn when and where to use nofollow links, there’s no better time than now!</p>



<h2>What <em>are</em> nofollow links?</h2>



<p>Before we can explain what nofollow links are, it’s important to understand what ‘PageRank’ is.</p>



<p>PageRank is a metric invented by Google’s owners. It takes a number of different factors into account to determine how trustworthy a page is.</p>



<p>Google formerly used PageRank to determine where a website would rank in search engine results. While Google no longer does this, PageRank still has indirect effects on ranking, such as:</p>



<ul><li>It’s one of a couple hundred ranking factors used by Google to decide a page’s popularity.</li><li><a href="https://oscwebdesign.biz/keyword-optimization-dead-topical-authority/">Topic relevant</a> backlinks from websites with a high PageRank will help improve page authority.</li><li>If you receive backlinks from sites with high PageRank in a fishy manner, you risk search engine penalties.</li></ul>



<p>Point is &#8211; you want to strive to increase your website’s PageRank.</p>



<p>When you link to an external website, Google considers this a vote for their credibility.&nbsp;<strong>The more you link out, the more you’re diluting your own page’s PageRank</strong>. In order to keep that precious PageRank and give credit where credit is due, the nofollow link comes into play.</p>



<h2>When to Use Nofollow Links</h2>



<p>Nofollow links can serve as a handy tool for giving credit to other websites without vouching for their credibility.</p>



<p>Say you found a quote in someone else’s blog that you’d like to share on your website, but you’re not certain of the website’s trustworthiness. This would be a great occasion to make use of a nofollow link.</p>



<p>Other scenarios you may want to use a nofollow link in:</p>



<h3>Badges on your website.</h3>



<p>You’re paying for “trust” badges like Norton to begin with and the Better Business Bureau already has enough PageRank on their own. Why pass them your PageRank for nothing?</p>



<h3>Paid links.</h3>



<p>Google considers crawlable paid links as a big no-no. <span style="font-weight: 400;">Here’s what </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google guidelines</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> say about paid links:</span></p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>In order to prevent paid links from influencing search results and negatively impacting users, we urge webmasters use nofollow on such links. Search engine guidelines require machine-readable disclosure of paid links in the same way that consumers online and offline appreciate disclosure of paid relationships (for example, a full-page newspaper ad may be headed by the word &#8220;Advertisement&#8221;).</p></blockquote>



<p>See Google guidelines for <a href="https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/66356?hl=en&amp;visit_id=1-636223605967405592-2601897724&amp;rd=1" rel="nofollow">more information on paid links</a>.</p>



<h3>Some internal links.</h3>



<p>Certain pages of your website really don’t need to rank in search engines. This includes your privacy policy, terms of service, login page, and register page. It’s better that the search engine “crawlers” spend the time on your website crawling more useful pages that contain keywords.</p>



<h3>Unfamiliar websites.</h3>



<p>Perhaps the main purpose of nofollow links is for linking to questionable websites. If you’re using a website as a bad example of something, you probably don’t want to send a vote of credibility their way.</p>



<h2>How to Use Nofollow Links</h2>



<p>When you view the HTML side of your website (or click the &#8216;text&#8217; tab when entering content into a WordPress website), you will see links that look like this:</p>



<h3><strong>Link that passes PageRank:</strong> </h3>



<p>&lt;a href=&#8221;http://www.website.com&#8221;>Text&lt;/a></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These links are automatically follow links. To change them to nofollow, it’s simple. Just add a bit of code after the ‘&lt;a’ and voilà.. It becomes a nofollow link.</span></p>



<h3><strong>Link that doesn&#8217;t pass PageRank:</strong></h3>



<p>&lt;a <strong><em>rel=&#8221;nofollow&#8221;</em></strong> href=&#8221;http://www.website.com&#8221;>Text&lt;/a></p>



<h2>Are nofollow links even relevant anymore?</h2>



<p>It’s been debated whether nofollow links still work. Reason being that Google can still ignore your suggestion and follow the link. According to <a href="https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/96569?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Google Webmaster Guidelines</a>, in general they do work:</p>


<p>In general, we don&#8217;t follow them. This means that Google does not transfer PageRank or anchor text across these links. Essentially, using nofollow causes us to drop the target links from our overall graph of the web. However, the target pages may still appear in our index if other sites link to them without using nofollow, or if the URLs are submitted to Google in a Sitemap. Also, it&#8217;s important to note that other search engines may handle nofollow in slightly different ways.</p>



<p>Although the “in general” part gives Google some wiggle room, it’s safe to say that nofollow links still work to some degree and serve a purpose.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You’ve already spent time compiling a list of keywords perfect for your website. All that’s left is to use them! But wait &#8211; <em>where</em> do you use them?</p>



<p>Placing keywords in the right places is almost as important as using them in the first place. By checking the following 6 places, you can be certain you’re taking the right steps to rank higher in search engines.</p>



<h2><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/26a0.png" alt="⚠" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> A Word of Warning</h2>



<h3>Be realistic.</h3>



<p>Perhaps you’ve heard the stories of websites ranking #1 simply by using a few keywords. In 2017, those stories sound more like legends and myths. Years ago Google caught on to “spammers” cheating to rank ahead of credible businesses and have been updating their ranking algorithm ever since.</p>



<p>Even so, keywords remain as one of the most important tools webmasters can control. &nbsp;Joining keywords with other SEO proven best practices contributes to a winning ranking strategy.</p>



<p>&#8220;In a world where most businesses are putting in effort to rank &#8211; you do not want to be the one business that doesn’t.&#8221; @osc_webdesign #SEO</p>



<h3>Don’t overdo it.</h3>



<p>Speaking of <a href="https://oscwebdesign.biz/warning-signs-dishonest-seo-company/">SEO spammers</a> and cheating.. There’s a fine line between using keywords effectively and keyword stuffing. If Google determines that you&#8217;re doing this or any other one of the banned practices outlined in their <a href="https://support.google.com/webmasters/topic/6001981?hl=en&amp;ref_topic=3309300">guidelines</a>, your website will be penalized or even banned from results.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><a href="https://oscwebdesign.biz/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/places-to-put-keywords.png"><img src="https://oscwebdesign.biz/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/places-to-put-keywords.png" alt="Search engine results keywords." class="wp-image-4218"/></a></figure></div>



<p>What’s keyword stuffing? To avoid it, a good rule of thumb is to ensure you put human readers and user-experience ahead of search engines. Below is an example keyword stuffing.<br></p>



<h2>Places in Your Website That Should Have Keywords</h2>



<p>It may be helpful for you to check your own website as you’re following along with this list. You can do that by right-clicking a page of your website, and selecting ‘Inspect’. Don’t be alarmed by the window of code that appears, you don’t have to be a developer to do this.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><a href="https://oscwebdesign.biz/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/check-for-keywords.png"><img src="https://oscwebdesign.biz/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/check-for-keywords-1024x384.png" alt="Checking for places with keywords." class="wp-image-4219"/></a></figure></div>



<p>By clicking ctrl + f to open the search bar, you can&nbsp;search for headers, etc. which will be explained below.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><a href="https://oscwebdesign.biz/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/finding-keywords.png"><img src="https://oscwebdesign.biz/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/finding-keywords-1024x359.png" alt="Looking for website keywords." class="wp-image-4220"/></a></figure></div>



<h3>1. Properly Formatted Headers</h3>



<p>These are a classic. Header tags (h1, h2, h3) have helped search engines identify the focus of websites for years. While not dramatically effective like they used to be, it’s still worth formatting page headers with these tags and including keywords in them.</p>



<h4>How to check your website’s headers.</h4>



<p>In the inspect window you’ve opened up, search for <span style="font-weight: 400;"> &lt;h1&gt;, &lt;h2&gt;, and &lt;h3&gt;.&nbsp;</span>When you hover over the code containing header tags, the area will be highlighted on the website as shown.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><a href="https://oscwebdesign.biz/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/keywords-headers.png"><img src="https://oscwebdesign.biz/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/keywords-headers-1024x279.png" alt="Headers with keywords." class="wp-image-4221"/></a></figure></div>



<h4>How to fix headers.</h4>



<p>Go through and look at each header to be sure a keyword is present. If not, perhaps you should rewrite your headers or format existing headers properly. This part is actually easy (code-free!) and you’ve likely done&nbsp;it before.</p>



<p>Simply log into the backend of your website and find the page you want to adjust. Highlight the text and choose your header (Heading 1 = h1 etc.). Here’s how the process looks with a WordPress website.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><a href="https://oscwebdesign.biz/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/headers-in-wordpress-for-seo.png"><img src="https://oscwebdesign.biz/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/headers-in-wordpress-for-seo.png" alt="Formatting headers in WordPress." class="wp-image-4222"/></a></figure></div>



<h4>How many headers to use.</h4>



<p>There’s no rule for this, but generally you should use one h1 tag (most important header, like the title of a service or blog), and as many h2s and h3s without turning your whole page into headers.</p>



<p>They should be applied in order of importance. For example:</p>



<p>&lt;h1&gt;United States&lt;/h1&gt;</p>



<p>&lt;h2&gt;Maine&lt;/h2&gt;</p>



<p>&lt;h3&gt;Scarborough&lt;/h3&gt;</p>



<h3>2. Social media profiles.</h3>



<p>While not technically <em>in</em> your website, your business’s social media accounts are connected to your website. It’s important to use relevant keywords in all places you leave a digital footprint.</p>



<p>Even if social media signals aren’t tracked by Google at all (something that’s been up for debate for a while) consistently using the same keywords will help with branding. What is your business known for? Which keywords do you want users type next to your brand when searching in Google?</p>



<p>Be sure to check your profile descriptions, taglines, and even post with keywords. At the very least keep your brand name consistent (we’ve had clients with different spelling variations on each platform!).</p>



<h3>3. Image file names and alt tags.</h3>



<p>We suggest making an effort to use at least one relevant image in each page of your website and blog post. This will give your website the opportunity to rank in Google image search, something that can be particularly helpful if you’ve created infographics and other branded images.</p>



<h4>How to check your alt tags for keywords.</h4>



<p>After logging in to the backend of your website, navigate to your media library. By clicking on each image, you can look see what the image title and alt tags are. Adjust both to include keywords, and save images you’re planning on using with relevant titles before uploading them.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><a href="https://oscwebdesign.biz/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/alt-tag-keywords.png"><img src="https://oscwebdesign.biz/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/alt-tag-keywords-1024x347.png" alt="Adjust website image alt tags." class="wp-image-4223"/></a></figure></div>



<h3>4. The first paragraph of your page.</h3>



<p>If possible, incorporate your keywords into the very first paragraph of the page you’re targeting them in. In cases when this doesn’t sound natural, use a header at the top of the page including the keywords.</p>



<h3>5. Title tags and meta descriptions.</h3>



<p>How do you ensure that users will click on your website once you do start ranking? Title tags and meta descriptions are important places to not only to include keywords in, but they also help boost your click-through rate.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><a href="https://oscwebdesign.biz/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/search-engine-result-seo.png"><img src="https://oscwebdesign.biz/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/search-engine-result-seo.png" alt="Search engine result with proper keyword placement." class="wp-image-4217"/></a></figure></div>



<p>Above you’ll see the text in purple is a title tag and the black/grey text below it is a meta description. If you don’t manually write your own, Google will pull an excerpt from your content automatically to display in search engine results.</p>



<p>If you don’t want to leave your website’s SEO entirely in the hands of Google, download the <a href="https://yoast.com/wordpress/plugins/seo/">Yoast SEO for WordPress plugin</a>. This helps your website’s SEO in a number of a ways and allows you write your own metas and titles without delving into code. Also.. it’s free!</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><a href="https://oscwebdesign.biz/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/keywords-meta-title.png"><img src="https://oscwebdesign.biz/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/keywords-meta-title.png" alt="Setting title and meta tags." class="wp-image-4224"/></a></figure></div>



<p>Another motivation for setting your title tags: these are what are displayed as a preview for your website in web browser tabs and other websites like social media.</p>



<h3>6. Throughout body content.</h3>



<p>Last but not least, don’t forget to use keywords fluidly throughout your body content. Focus on including them in a way that makes sense for the reader; typically anywhere from 3-10 times depending on the length of your content.</p>



<h2><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2b50.png" alt="⭐" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Pro-Tip: Using Structured Data to Help Google Understand Content</h2>



<p>The <a href="https://www.google.com/webmasters/markup-helper/u/0/">Structured Data Markup Helper</a> is a free webmaster tool provided by Google. In plain terms, the code provided with this tool helps Google software understand what your content means.</p>



<p>This gives your website the opportunity to rank in rich snippets, as shown in the example below.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://oscwebdesign.biz/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/keywords-in-rich-snippets.png" alt="Optimizing for rich snippets." class="wp-image-4225"/><figcaption>From <a href="https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/3069489?hl=en">Google’s Support page</a>.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>When Google understands your website, they can better showcase your content and further increase your click-through rate!</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<p>Incorporating keywords into your website is by no means the only part of search engine optimization, but it remains an important piece.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>What a Dishonest SEO Company Can Cost You</h2>
<p>We don’t have a whole lot of empathy for shady SEO firms. Yes, everyone’s trying to make a living, but they make theirs by stepping all over small businesses.</p>
<p>A bad SEO company can cost you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ranking penalties from Google.</li>
<li>Getting banned completely from search engine results.</li>
<li>Money and time to attempt fixing this.</li>
<li>Your business’s reputation.</li>
</ul>
<p>Search engine penalties are very difficult to bounce back from. In the following video, a small business owner sent a question to Matt Cutts, former head of the Google Webspam team:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Matt, Does the good guys still stand a chance? We&#8217;re a small company that hired an SEO firm that we thought was legit, but destroyed our rankings w/ spam backlinks. We&#8217;ve tried everything but nothing helps. What can a company with good intentions do?”</p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2jap11IIxfw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>As you saw for yourself, Matt doesn’t seem to have a whole lot of sympathy. Even though this business essentially got duped by a dishonest SEO company, the way Google looks at it, your business should be researching these firms before hiring them.</p>
<p>Luckily for you, your business won’t get fooled! The following warning signs are pretty surefire indications that you’re dealing with a deceitful SEO company.</p>
<h2>Warning sign #1: They are vague regarding their methods.</h2>
<p>SEO takes time, effort, and skill &#8211; but it’s not rocket science. An SEO company should be able to explain their approaches in plain terms.</p>
<p>Are they beating around the bush? Do they claim to have “proprietary methods”?</p>
<p>That’s just not how search engine optimization works. The majority of SEO is all over the web for anyone to see. Take our blog posts for example &#8211; if you have the time and desire, you could learn much of what you need to know just by reading each post.</p>
<p>Of course, there are certain programs that SEO companies pay to use for their clients, but they should still be able to tell you which they use or at least a broad overview of their functions.</p>
<p>If they are explaining their approaches and you don’t quite understand, simply ask for clarification. You’re paying them to make changes to <em>your website</em>.. You have the right to know what’s going on.</p>
<h2>Warning sign #2: They claim they can get you ranking #1.</h2>
<p>While a trustworthy SEO company shouldn’t be vague in their approaches, they’re likely to be somewhat general regarding time and ranking spot.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Experienced SEO firms care about their reputation and customer satisfaction. They care about whether they fulfill their promises or not. When it comes to SEO, you can have a general idea on results, but we promise there isn’t one company out there that can know exactly where Google will rank your website.</p>
<p>[ctt template=&#8221;3&#8243; link=&#8221;h3cJq&#8221; via=&#8221;no&#8221; ]“Nobody knows the inner workings of Google’s algorithms &#8211; except Google. Don’t be fooled by claims from shady #SEO firms.&#8221; @osc_webdesign[/ctt]</p>
<h2>Warning sign #3: They say you’ll see results in days.</h2>
<p>Like we’ve already mentioned, sometimes when claims are too specific, it’s a sign you’re dealing with a dishonest SEO company. Lasting, credible search engine optimization should take anywhere from four months to a year for you to start seeing results.</p>
<p>Perhaps you’ve received emails offering “We can get you ranking in 24 HOURS!” Are these people flat out lying? Actually, not always.</p>
<p>Many dishonest SEO companies take part in “black hat SEO”. This involves a number of tactics that have been banned by Google and will result in a penalty for your website. In the meantime though, they can actually get your website ranking quite high, quite quickly &#8211; until you’re not.</p>
<p>When Google catches on, your website will likely be penalized or banned from search results. It will take a very long time to get your business out of this mess, and (as you saw in the video) Google will have little sympathy for your plight.</p>
<p>Wondering why credible SEO seems slow? Check out this article on <a href="https://oscwebdesign.biz/seo-take-long/">why SEO takes so long</a>.</p>
<h2>Warning sign #4: They have links for sale.</h2>
<p>As you can see below, this dishonest SEO company is offering an unholy trio of bad SEO offers.</p>
<p>“Get Top 10 on Google”<br />
“Within 3-6 Months”<br />
“Buy DA40-DA100 Backlinks From $1 per Link!”</p>
<p><a href="https://oscwebdesign.biz/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/black-hat-seo-company-1.png"><img loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-4162 aligncenter" src="https://oscwebdesign.biz/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/black-hat-seo-company-1.png" alt="Dishonest SEO company example." width="870" height="410" /></a></p>
<p>The ‘DA40-DA-100’ refers to the supposed <a href="https://oscwebdesign.biz/improve-domain-authority-possible/">domain authority</a> of the websites you’d be buying backlinks from. Domain authority is an up to 100-point score calculated by <a href="https://moz.com/learn/seo/domain-authority" rel="nofollow">Moz</a> that estimates how credible your website is. The more trustworthy and credible you are, the higher you will rank.</p>
<p>We’ll tell you one thing for certain; websites with high domain authority <strong>will not be selling links</strong>. Selling links is actually a practice that has been banned by Google for years. Here’s what Google has to say on the subject in their <a href="https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/66356" rel="nofollow">quality guidelines</a>:</p>
<p><em>‘Any links intended to manipulate PageRank or a site&#8217;s ranking in Google search results may be considered part of a link scheme and a violation of Google’s Webmaster Guidelines. This includes any behavior that manipulates links to your site or outgoing links from your site.</em><br />
<em> The following are examples of link schemes which can negatively impact a site&#8217;s ranking in search results:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Buying or selling links that pass PageRank. This includes exchanging money for links, or posts that contain links; exchanging goods or services for links; or sending someone a “free” product in exchange for them writing about it and including a link</em></li>
<li><em>Excessive link exchanges (&#8220;Link to me and I&#8217;ll link to you&#8221;) or partner pages exclusively for the sake of cross-linking</em></li>
<li><em>Large-scale article marketing or guest posting campaigns with keyword-rich anchor text links</em></li>
<li><em>Using automated programs or services to create links to your site’</em></li>
</ul>
<h2>Warning sign #5: They promise you a specific number of links each month.</h2>
<p>As you know, buying links is a big no-no. That means you have to head the route Google wants you to go, which is earning them by creating great content on your website that people want to link to.</p>
<p>Dishonest SEO companies hate this route. They don’t want to spend hours researching keywords and writing content, they want to spam as many places as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>When you earn links the right way, you can never predict the number of backlinks you will receive. It’s all up to who reads your content and if they like it.</p>
<h2>Warning sign #6: Their messages are littered with spelling errors and little personalization.</h2>
<p>The business model of most spammers, including spammy SEO companies, is “the more the better”. They push out as many offers as possible in hopes that someone will take the bait.</p>
<p>It only makes sense, as they’re attempting to send out thousands of emails etc., that they will have very little personalization for the recipients. If you’ve been sent an SEO proposal and they can’t even get your business’s name right, that’s a bad sign in any event.</p>

<p>You don’t have to be an SEO guru to sense something’s “off”. Go with your gut &#8211; if an SEO company seems suspicious, don’t gamble with your business’s future online.</p>The post <a href="https://oscwebdesign.biz/warning-signs-dishonest-seo-company/">6 Warning Signs of a Dishonest SEO Company</a> appeared first on <a href="https://oscwebdesign.biz">AACHDEV</a>.]]></content:encoded>
