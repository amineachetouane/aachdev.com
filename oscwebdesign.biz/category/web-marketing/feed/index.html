										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Congratulations, you&#8217;ve decided to join the social media world. Now for the tough part&#8230;<strong>where do you start?</strong></p>



<h2 id="h-what-social-platform-should-i-choose">What social platform should I choose?</h2>



<p>Sadly, we can&#8217;t quickly answer &#8220;what social media network is right for you&#8221; in an instant&#8230;and neither can you. It takes research and work.</p>



<p>To start, talk to your customers. Ask them where they like to spend their time online. Is it Facebook? Twitter? LinkedIn? YouTube? Instagram? Pinterest?&nbsp;Once you find out where your audience spends their time, do your research. Search for your industry (and brand) keywords in order to see if your audience is talking about you or your subject matter.</p>



<h2 id="h-be-where-your-audience-is">Be where your audience is</h2>



<p>Now that you&#8217;ve found out where your audience lives online, it&#8217;s time to create a powerful presence there.&nbsp;Start by filling out as much information as possible in your profile. That includes branded photos.</p>



<p>Acquire a following by creating great content and incorporate advertising into your strategy as well.</p>



<h2 id="h-captivate-your-audience">Captivate your audience</h2>



<p>Last but certainly not least, it&#8217;s time to engage your audience.</p>



<p>Since you found them on the network they use the most, it&#8217;s important to <a href="https://oscwebdesign.biz/4-ways-engage-facebook-users/">talk about what your audience is interested in</a>. Try posting images and videos, incorporating factual or &#8220;did you know?&#8221; posts, infographics, true/false questions, and other ways that get your customers liking and commenting.</p>



<h2>Here&#8217;s a 5 minute video on what social media platform you should choose</h2>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Your seafood business relies on regular business in order to not only survive, but thrive. Integrating the right online marketing tactics is one of the best ways you can harness opportunities for reaching and engaging with both potential and existing customers.</p>



<p>Here are 15 ways to market your seafood business online.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="768" height="411" src="https://oscwebdesign.biz/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/create-memorable-branding.jpg" alt="Create better branding online for your seafood business." class="wp-image-3673" srcset="https://oscwebdesign.biz/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/create-memorable-branding.jpg 768w, https://oscwebdesign.biz/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/create-memorable-branding-300x161.jpg 300w, https://oscwebdesign.biz/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/create-memorable-branding-600x321.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></figure>



<ol><li><strong>Know who your customers are.<br></strong>Before you can market to anyone, you need to know who your seafood company is marketing <em>to</em>. Do you tend to deal with local customers or tourists? Are most of your customers men, women, or both? Do you have a lot of customers who buy raw seafood or prefer cooked meals?<br></li><li><strong>Understand how you stand out.<br></strong>What does your seafood business have that no one else has? What makes you different and worthwhile for customers to come to instead of your competition? Talk about your value proposition&#8230;and talk about it often.<strong><br></strong></li><li><strong>What problems do you solve?<br></strong>Take your value proposition a step further by understanding the problems you solve for your customers. Do you provide fresh, local seafood that keeps families eating healthy? Do you provide other businesses with fresh catches at a fair price?<br></li><li><strong>Work hard to keep existing customers.<br></strong>Marketing doesn’t mean simply to new customers; it’s also vital for your existing customers. According to Forbes, it costs five times as much to acquire a new customer than keep an existing customer. Consider how your seafood business can continuously keep existing customers engaged so they keep coming back time and time again.<br></li><li><strong>Create memorable branding.<br></strong>With your target audience and value proposition in mind, design (or have branding designed) that speaks to you as a seafood company. Ensure your branding (logo, coloring, fonts, tagline, etc.) appear on any and all marketing materials to keep total cohesion.<strong><br></strong></li><li><strong>Create an online hub for customers: your website.<br></strong>It’s beneficial for any form of seafood business &#8211; from fishermen to distributors to restaurants &#8211; to have a website that gives potential customers information that they need to do business with you. Your website should be user focused and user friendly, highlighting clear calls-to-action (or what you want visitors to do next).<br></li><li><strong>Consider content creation.<br></strong>Creating regular content that brings in new customers and engages existing customers will help establish your seafood company as the go-to business in your niche. It also adds incredible value for your customers. Post articles, recipes, and even videos to engage with your audience.<strong><br></strong></li><li><strong>Optimize your online presence with SEO.<br></strong>Harnessing the power of Search Engine Optimization will help your seafood organization be found through the search engines. Since a whopping 93% of online interactions start with a search, it’s critical you’re there. Use the same keywords your audience is searching for on your website and gain as many relevant incoming links as you can.<br></li><li><strong>Don’t forget about local search.<br></strong>If you’re a local business, it’s also imperative to show up in the Google “snack pack” (or local search results). List your seafood company on Google My Business, Yelp, Facebook, and other local listing sites that make sense for you.<br></li><li><strong>Promote with ads.<br></strong>When your organic promotional tactics need a little help, ads such as Google ads or social media ads, are a great way to attract even more potential customers.<strong><br></strong></li><li><strong>Engage with social media.<br></strong>Seafood companies have a unique opportunity within social media: food images are powerful, can be very beautiful, and are a great way to engage your audience. Platforms like Instagram, which is very image-focused, is a great way to attract a following.<br></li><li><strong>Follow up with emails.<br></strong>An email newsletter is still the most high converting form of digital marketing, with averages around 4%. Touching base regularly reminds your customers you’re there and adding a great resource (like a fun recipe) will help you stand out.<br></li><li><strong>Never stop measuring.<br></strong>One of the greatest aspects of digital marketing is that you can measure everything you do. Pay attention using tools like Google Analytics to better understand how your digital marketing efforts are engaging customers.<strong><br></strong></li><li><strong>Pay special attention to what’s working.<br></strong>It should go without saying that you should continue doing what’s working for your seafood company, but it’s just as easy for many business owners to overlook! Using your online analytics data to determine what marketing tactics are bringing in business.<strong><br></strong></li><li><strong>Change what’s not working.<br></strong>Similarly, be sure to change, adjust, or simply stop doing the digital marketing tactics that <em>aren’t </em>working for you. If Instagram isn’t the place for you, try different types of content altogether, then move on to another social media platform.</li></ol>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Imagine a long line of customers waiting outside your shop, eager to purchase your amazing products. Or picture logging into your Ecommerce platform to discover sales have doubled overnight.</p>



<p>More sales is the goal of every retail store owner and now, more than ever, it’s important to market your retail business using the power of digital marketing. By incorporating consistent online marketing in your business, you’ll be able to reach your customers in a way you never have before. You’ll also have the opportunity to show the value of your products and improve your sales by engaging with your potential customers.</p>



<p>Here’s how to use online marketing to make more sales for your retail company.</p>



<h2><strong>GIVE AWAY FREE INFORMATION.</strong></h2>



<p>It may feel counterintuitive to give anything away for free, but free content actually establishes you as the leader and expert in your niche. When you’re seen as the expert, potential customers are that much more likely to purchase from you. After all, here you are reading our tips, right?</p>



<h3><strong>How do you put this into practice?</strong> </h3>



<p>Think about how you can add value for your audience through content, such as blogposts or articles, social media, video, and so on.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="768" height="411" src="https://oscwebdesign.biz/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/give-away-free-information.jpg" alt="Give away free information to your following" class="wp-image-3587" srcset="https://oscwebdesign.biz/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/give-away-free-information.jpg 768w, https://oscwebdesign.biz/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/give-away-free-information-300x161.jpg 300w, https://oscwebdesign.biz/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/give-away-free-information-600x321.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></figure>



<p><br><em>Example</em></p>



<p>Let’s say you own a sporting goods store. You sell everything from baseballs and soccer balls to athletic shoes to jerseys for the local teams. You primarily target parents, as you have a wide variety of youth sporting goods.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You decide to create content on your blog around subjects like “The Top 10 Reasons Why Sports Help Your Kids Become Incredible Adults” and “How to Find the Sport Your Child Will Love.”</p>



<p>You also create video tutorial content on YouTube like “How to Properly Throw a Football with the Perfect Spiral” and “Why You Aren’t Making 3-Point Shots.”</p>



<p>You share all of this content in your social media channels, along with quick tips you find from professional athletes who give some secrets of their success away.</p>



<h2><strong>USE ADS TO YOUR BENEFIT.</strong></h2>



<p>Online ads don’t have to break the bank. A well designed and targeted ad campaign can do wonders when it comes to driving qualified leads to your retail website.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>How do you put this into practice?</strong> </h3>



<p>Use platforms where your customers spend their time online using the right social media tool and very specifically targeting your ideal audience. You can also incorporate retargeting ads to stay top of mind and geotargeting for a local audience.</p>



<p><br><em>Example</em></p>



<p>You run a comic book store and you target graphic novel lovers, specifically collectors as you have a wide variety of collectors’ edition comic books.</p>



<p>You run regular ads on Facebook for potential customers in your geographic area who like pages such as Marvel and DC Comics, and who self identify liking graphic novels in their profile.</p>



<p>You also run retargeting ads for visitors to your website, along with a Google shopping ad campaign that showcases your vintage collectors’ edition books.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>ENGAGE YOUR CUSTOMERS REGULARLY.</strong></h2>



<p>Engaging your customers online is vital in converting leads into customers. Humans crave engagement in the relationships they form &#8211; and relationships with businesses are no different! The more you can stand out by engaging your community, the more likely you’ll be creating customers for life.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="768" height="411" src="https://oscwebdesign.biz/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/engage-your-customers.jpg" alt="Engage your customers on social media" class="wp-image-3588" srcset="https://oscwebdesign.biz/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/engage-your-customers.jpg 768w, https://oscwebdesign.biz/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/engage-your-customers-300x161.jpg 300w, https://oscwebdesign.biz/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/engage-your-customers-600x321.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></figure>



<h3><strong>How do you put this into practice?</strong> </h3>



<p>Social media and email newsletters are some of the best ways to regularly engage your customers, as you have a direct line to them in these ways.</p>



<p><br><em>Example</em></p>



<p>You run a small, local supermarket that specializes in locally sourced and grown foods and drinks. You target the surrounding community and those people who value food that comes from close to home.</p>



<p>You engage your customers regularly on your social media account by sharing photos and videos they’ve shared on their personal social accounts. In fact, you even run campaigns around asking customers to share their favorite recipes using your products and share the winners on your channels, who receive a gift card to your shop.</p>



<p>You also email your list once a week to talk about the sales, specials, and new products you have on the shelves that week. In addition, your email always includes a recipe that showcases seasonal foods.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<p>Use these three digital marketing strategies to start making more sales for your retail business.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Marketing has changed drastically for wholesalers and distributors. Not only have customers grown to rely on user friendly Ecommerce platforms, but COVID has forced companies to do business solely online more than ever.</p>



<p>Here’s why your distribution company isn’t succeeding online.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Your website isn’t up to par.</strong></h2>



<p>Forget Ecommerce for a moment. If you don’t have a website at all or don’t have a user friendly, expertly designed website, your customers are going to think twice about doing business with you.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After all, 75% of people base their opinion of a website on design, according to Digital Apeel. That means it’s high time to get your website up to code (pun intended).</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="768" height="411" src="https://oscwebdesign.biz/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/adopting-digital-marketing-distribution-website.jpg" alt="Digital Marketing for Distribution Website" class="wp-image-3579" srcset="https://oscwebdesign.biz/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/adopting-digital-marketing-distribution-website.jpg 768w, https://oscwebdesign.biz/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/adopting-digital-marketing-distribution-website-300x161.jpg 300w, https://oscwebdesign.biz/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/adopting-digital-marketing-distribution-website-600x321.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></figure>



<h2><strong>You don’t have product listings.</strong></h2>



<p>Again, forget about Ecommerce functionality right now and the ability to purchase products directly from your website. If your distribution company isn’t even <em>listing</em> the products you offer, you’re missing a big opportunity.</p>



<p>Not only do potential customers miss what they can purchase from you, but you’re also losing out on potential SEO benefits too. Your customers are searching for products just like yours online and, if you don’t have product listings on your site, you’re never going to be found for them.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="768" height="411" src="https://oscwebdesign.biz/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/website-isnt-selling-products.jpg" alt="Wholesale website isn't selling products" class="wp-image-3581" srcset="https://oscwebdesign.biz/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/website-isnt-selling-products.jpg 768w, https://oscwebdesign.biz/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/website-isnt-selling-products-300x161.jpg 300w, https://oscwebdesign.biz/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/website-isnt-selling-products-600x321.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></figure>



<h2><strong>You’re relying too heavily on salespeople.</strong></h2>



<p>Many distribution companies thrive successfully on a sales team model. That doesn’t have to change.</p>



<p>However, by providing a powerful website to backup your salespeople, you’re giving your business a better chance of making the sale and a new customer relationship.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A professional website full of well-crafted product listings will give potential customers a place to see what your business has to offer before, during, and after their interaction with your sales team. Plus, the sales rep can still get credit for the purchase. That’s how they work together for a common goal.</p>



<h2><strong>You’re not adopting digital marketing into the mix.</strong></h2>



<p>Your quarterly company newsletter may have helped boost sales in the early 2000’s, but your customer base is yearning for much more now.</p>



<p>Customers want to be engaged through helpful and resourceful content. That can certainly come in a regular email newsletter (which still boasts the highest conversion rates of most online marketing tactics), a blog, social media, or even video marketing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Expanding your digital marketing efforts will not only engage your existing customers you’re there to serve, but it will also help reach new potential customers, as well.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<p>How is your distribution company faring online? Are you succeeding with these practices or do you have some more work to do?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Is your restaurant considering online ordering via a website or an app? Are you having trouble deciding which one is right for you?</p>



<p>Never fear; OSC is here to help. Below you’ll find the benefits for keeping online restaurant orders on your website vs. on an app.</p>



<h2><strong>Website Restaurant Orders</strong></h2>



<p>Creating a safe, secure, and user friendly ordering system on your website is no easy feat, but doing so will ensure your customers are able to get exactly what they want from your menu.</p>



<p>If you choose to set up an online ordering option through a new or existing website, you’ll need to ensure that all the proper systems are in place.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Your website needs to properly communicate with your POS system and inform your staff of what was ordered. In addition, you’ll need a talented web design and development team to create an ordering interface that is user friendly and secure for customers.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="768" height="411" src="https://oscwebdesign.biz/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/restaurant-online-orders-website-design.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-3572" srcset="https://oscwebdesign.biz/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/restaurant-online-orders-website-design.jpg 768w, https://oscwebdesign.biz/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/restaurant-online-orders-website-design-300x161.jpg 300w, https://oscwebdesign.biz/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/restaurant-online-orders-website-design-600x321.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></figure>



<h3><em>Website Benefits</em></h3>



<ul><li>Time and money savings<br>The cost of design and development for a website is often far less than an app, including any ongoing costs.<br></li><li>SEO opportunities<br>Keeping your ordering system in house will give you additional SEO benefits, as well as piggyback off any Search Engine Optimization efforts completed on the website itself. Conversely, apps have no SEO benefits whatsoever and have even more competition in contending for the top spots in the App Store.<br></li><li>Mobile friendly<br>When built correctly, a website ordering system for your restaurant is still just as mobile friendly (or responsive) and user friendly as an app.<br></li><li>Fewer updates<br>Unlike app development, website updates (though a reality) typically happen less often and are less financially taxing than app updates.</li></ul>



<h2><strong>App Restaurant Orders</strong></h2>



<p>With so many smartphone users (81% of Americans, according to the Pew Research Center), it’s no wonder that so many restaurant owners are interested in app development for food ordering.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Coupled with opportunities to work with third party apps like Uber Eats or GrubHub, using an app to sell your food may be the right fit for your business.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="768" height="411" src="https://oscwebdesign.biz/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/restaurant-online-orders-app.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-3573" srcset="https://oscwebdesign.biz/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/restaurant-online-orders-app.jpg 768w, https://oscwebdesign.biz/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/restaurant-online-orders-app-300x161.jpg 300w, https://oscwebdesign.biz/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/restaurant-online-orders-app-600x321.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></figure>



<h3><em>App Benefits</em></h3>



<ul><li><strong>Mobile users<br></strong>With 90% of mobile time spent in apps (vs. browsers), according to Flurry, it stands to reason that mobile users are more comfortable and have a higher preference for using high quality apps.<br></li><li><strong>GPS opportunities<br></strong>Offering geo-specific menu recommendations to your customers or even real time GPS delivery notifications will go far in your customers’ experience using your app. These features are unmatched in a website experience.<br></li><li><strong>Convenience</strong><br>Apps often offer added convenience, such as saving payment methods, orders, and even food preferences. All of these settings offer added convenience to your customers.<br></li><li><strong>Loyalty programs<br></strong>Apps allow for easier loyalty program integration for your restaurant. For instance, a “buy 10 sandwiches, get one free” program.</li></ul>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<p>Which option makes more sense for your restaurant &#8211; the app or the website? Seeing the benefits side by side should help you make the decision that’s right for your business.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Thanks for joining us for the final installment in 10 Online Strategies (that work!) to Market Your Retail Business During COVID. If you haven&#8217;t checked out strategies 1-6, make sure to check out <a href="/10-online-strategies-that-work-to-market-your-retail-business-during-covid-part-1/">Part 1</a> &amp; <a href="/10-online-strategies-that-work-to-market-your-retail-business-during-covid-part-2/">Part 2</a>. </p>



<h3><strong>7. Sell fewer products.</strong></h3>



<p>There is nothing worse for a potential customer than to come to your website and immediately feel overwhelmed. Too many products will do that.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We know, we know. This may feel unfathomable. But with more choices comes more second guessing, indecision, and potential customers leaving the site. In order to keep your audience focused, keep your products focused as well.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>Your to do task:</em></p>



<p>Take a good, honest look at the products you offer and consider where you can scale back, categorize, or reorganize them further.</p>



<h3><strong>8. Don’t skimp on product descriptions or images.</strong></h3>



<p>In the retail space, product images and descriptions are what can make or break your sales. Think about it: when customers are online, they have no other choice than to judge products based on the image and description. They aren’t able to feel, smell, taste, or otherwise “test out” the product in person.</p>



<p>Your <strong>images</strong><strong><em> </em></strong>should be high resolution and high quality, as well as show off the product’s features, using multiple images if need be.</p>



<p>Your <strong>description</strong> should be keyword rich (to optimize for SEO) and contain plenty of honest benefits that the product offers. Meanwhile, the description should also be short and sweet, to ensure potential customers don’t lose interest.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>Your to do task:</em></p>



<p>Review all of your products to ensure you don’t have any missed opportunities in the image or description.</p>



<h3><strong>9. Continue to think local.</strong></h3>



<p>If your online storefront also has a brick and mortar location, it’s vital to your survival to continue thinking with a local mindset. Since many areas in the country have now opened back up during the COVID pandemic, this is your opportunity to start driving foot traffic back into your storefront.</p>



<p>There are a number of ways you can target your audience locally. Here are just a few ideas:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Geotarget</strong> your audience with ads through Google Ads or social media channels like Facebook and YouTube.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Use language</strong> that makes sense for your geographic audience, such as special phrases or keywords. (For instance, here in Maine, we might use the word “wicked” instead of “very.”)</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Incorporate images</strong> of local areas everywhere so that your audience identifies with their surroundings.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Stay up-to-date with local listings</strong>, including responding to reviews (if necessary) and updating information and images or video frequently.<br></li></ul>



<p><em>Your to do task:</em></p>



<p>You can do your due diligence locally by completing all or some of the four tips above, depending on what makes sense for your retail business.</p>



<h3><strong>10. Consider ads and remarketing campaigns.</strong></h3>



<p>When created and managed effectively, online ads and remarketing campaigns can have a profound effect on the bottom line for retail shops.</p>



<p>First up: <strong>ad campaigns</strong>. From Google Ads to Facebook and Instagram to YouTube to banner ads in online magazine sites, there are no shortage of advertising options for the retail space. Choose wisely by promoting where your audience spends their time and work with a professional to ensure your campaign gets the most for your investment.</p>



<p>Google Shopping, specifically, offers retail businesses a unique opportunity to combine product images, reviews, store locations (if you have multiple), and online ordering to give searchers the exact products they’re looking for.</p>



<p>Next up: <strong>remarketing campaigns</strong>. These campaigns are ideal for every type of retail store, as they can drastically increase your conversion rates. By “reminding” customers who have visited your website via ads on other websites and social networks, you’re effectively adding additional touchpoints. (Remember: it takes an average of <em>7 touchpoints</em> &#8211; or impressions &#8211; to make the sale.)</p>



<p>Simply because a visitor bounced from your website doesn’t mean they’re lost as a customer. They just aren’t convinced yet&#8230;and remarketing is the perfect opportunity.</p>



<p><em>Your to do task:</em></p>



<p>Consider whether an ad and/or remarketing campaign fits within your marketing plan and budget. Then, find a reputable marketing firm to help you set them up.</p>



<p>And there you have it! Ten tips that will actually help your online retail business right now. Ready to put one (or all!) of these strategies to good use? Awesome.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Let&#8217;s keep the momentum going with  the 4th, 5th &amp; 6th strategies to help you market your retail business during COVID. If you haven&#8217;t yet read the first 3 strategies, check them out by reading <a href="/10-online-strategies-that-work-to-market-your-retail-business-during-covid-part-1/">part 1</a> to this series. </p>



<p><strong>4. Don’t keep discounts to yourself.</strong></p>



<p>When your retail space offers discounts, sales, or special deals, don’t assume that your potential customers will constantly be checking your website or retail location. Instead, remember these additional ways to announce big discounts via email.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Entice first time buyers on your website. </strong>Offer first time buyers a special coupon code when they sign up for emails. A 10 or 15% off code is a great way to build your email list and create new customers, then have the potential of creating long-time customers.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Follow up with discounts.</strong> Once a customer has made a purchase, set up a system to automatically email them with a discount for a given time period. Customers are much more likely to use discounts when there is an expiration date.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Send out regular discounts. </strong>Staying top of mind to your customer base ensures more sales. Regularly email your list with discounts to reward their loyalty by offering an incentive to shop.</li></ul>



<p><em>Your to do task:</em></p>



<p>If you haven’t already, start an email newsletter list. Then, create opportunities for one or all of the above for customer discounts.</p>



<p><strong>5. Use the power of Word of Mouth with product reviews.</strong></p>



<p>No matter what type of product you offer, incorporating product reviews in your online store will help engage potential customers in a way you can’t as the store owner: by using real customers.</p>



<p>Existing happy customers are amongst your best resources for gaining new business. Think about it: word of mouth is still one of the most profitable marketing sources, and this is the next best thing&#8230;WOM from strangers. After all, they’ve used and experienced your product and then told their (unbiased) story about it.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>Your to do task:</em></p>



<p>Acquire as many reviews from happy customers as possible. If possible, avoid having them off-site (on Google My Business, Facebook, or something similar) as they’ll give you more benefit as a retail store on your website. That means you’ll need the infrastructure on your site to allow customers to create star ratings and write reviews on a product-by-product basis.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>6. Anticipate customers’ needs.</strong></p>



<p>There’s no better shopping experience than when the retail store anticipates your needs. Here are a few ideas to implement online so your customers feel their needs are being not only met, but exceeded!</p>



<ul><li><strong>Say thank you. </strong>While it may seem like a no brainer, a digital shopping experience obviously doesn’t have the same personal touch as shopping in-store. To help with this, your online store should automatically send customers a receipt or order summary and shipping information, along with a simple “thank you for your order” to let them know you appreciate the business.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Follow up.</strong> Just like discount emails, make sure you regularly follow up with customers based on their purchases. There are plenty of Ecommerce email solutions that will help with follow up based on prior customer purchases.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Similar products. </strong>Similar to following up, you have the opportunity to showcase similar products within your online storefront. Upselling or cross-selling on your products pages may help potential customers see products they may not have, or entice them to level up to a higher priced or quality product.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Shopping cart reminders. </strong>The statistics on the number of abandoned shopping carts are staggering (the average rate is 70%!) when you think about the potential lost revenue. Alleviate your shopping cart abandonment rates by reminding potential customers to finish checking out. Suggest all users login to make purchases so your system can track &#8211; then contact via email &#8211; potential customers who have abandoned their cart. A simple “Did you forget something?” email can do wonders.</li></ul>



<p><em>Your to do task:</em></p>



<p>Determine which of the tips from above apply to your retail store and which you can start implementing immediately. (Hint: Saying thank you is easy and worthwhile.)</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In these unusual times, engaging your audience online can make or break your retail business.&nbsp;</p>



<p>By putting more effort into your online presence, you’ll go from worrying about gaining traffic on your website to improving organic search results to improving your digital conversion rates.</p>



<p>Here are 10 online strategies (that really work!) to market your retail business during COVID (and beyond).</p>



<h3><strong>1. Create a phenomenal user experience.</strong></h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="768" height="411" src="https://oscwebdesign.biz/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/convert-retail-to-online-ordering.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-3540" srcset="https://oscwebdesign.biz/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/convert-retail-to-online-ordering.jpg 768w, https://oscwebdesign.biz/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/convert-retail-to-online-ordering-300x161.jpg 300w, https://oscwebdesign.biz/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/convert-retail-to-online-ordering-600x321.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></figure>



<p>A retail website can’t afford a poor user experience. You’ll quickly lose potential customers (and income) with a confusing navigation structure, poorly written content, an unsecure shopping cart, a non-responsive site, and so on. Here’s where to focus your energy:</p>



<p><strong>Create a navigation structure that makes sense. </strong>The good news for you is that creating a great user experience isn’t rocket science; many of the steps are really quite simple&#8230;including the navigation structure.</p>



<p>Create a page (and product) structure that makes sense for your users. For many retail companies, that means a hierarchy of product categories, followed by the products themselves.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Be sure to avoid “cutesy” names that won’t make sense for visitors and make any links crystal clear for where they lead. Speaking of links, breadcrumbs are a very helpful tactic for online retail shops.</p>



<p><strong>Ensure a secure and easy-to-use shopping cart. </strong>We’ve all experienced shopping carts that just don’t <em>feel</em> right. You know the type &#8211; confusing, difficult to navigate, and look entirely unsecure. The goal here is to ensure the fewest number of abandoned carts as possible (more on that later).</p>



<p>Eliminate any unnecessary fields and require the fewest amount of fields possible. In addition, keep the steps during checkout to a minimum. As with many website-related recommendations: the fewer the clicks, the better!</p>



<p><strong>Create customer-focused content. </strong>It’s easy to focus on the features your product provides &#8211; its color, size, shape, general use, etc. Instead, consider focusing on the <em>benefits</em> it provides your customers. What problem(s) will it solve for them?&nbsp;</p>



<p>By thinking about your products by benefit, rather than function, you’ll reach your customers on a deeper level and showcase how your products stand out from the competition.</p>



<p><strong>Create a responsive (mobile friendly) website. </strong>In 2020, it’s no longer an option to have a website that doesn’t respond to any screen it’s shown on. What’s more is by having a poor user experience with a non mobile friendly site, you’ll actually lose footing in your search engine results.</p>



<p>If you’re curious about whether your website is responsive, check out the <a href="https://search.google.com/test/mobile-friendly">Google Mobile Friendly Test</a>.</p>



<p><em>Your to do task:</em></p>



<p>Follow the recommendations above and partner with a web development company who specializes in retail company sites who can give you the right recommendations.</p>



<h3><strong>2. Understand who you’re talking to &amp; engage with them where they spend their time.</strong></h3>



<p>You may have a general sense of who your ideal customer is….but do you really know them?</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="768" height="411" src="https://oscwebdesign.biz/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/create-user-experiences.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-3539" srcset="https://oscwebdesign.biz/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/create-user-experiences.jpg 768w, https://oscwebdesign.biz/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/create-user-experiences-300x161.jpg 300w, https://oscwebdesign.biz/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/create-user-experiences-600x321.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></figure>



<p><strong>Create buyer profiles or personas </strong>to help identify the people you’re talking to. Giving your ideal audience faces and names (typically there will be at least 2-3 personas) will help establish who you’re talking to in your marketing efforts. Get super specific with information about their demographics, interests, problems that need solving, and so on.</p>



<p>Then<strong> spend time where your customers are</strong>. This seems like a simple concept, but it’s actually one that many retail business owners gloss over. There’s no sense in putting time, money, and effort into online spaces that your customers don’t spend time in.</p>



<p>Taking things a step further, it’s critical you engage with ideal customers (rather than talking <em>at</em> them) in order to help improve your bottom line.</p>



<p><em>Your to do task:</em></p>



<p>Do your due diligence in researching your ideal customers’ personas, along with where they spend their time online (types of content, social media, etc.).</p>



<h3><strong>3. Establish expertise through free content (and even free stuff).</strong></h3>



<p>Introduce new customers to your business and your products through free information or, if you can swing it, free stuff. Not only do people love getting things for free, but you now have better access to your ideal audience for reviews, feedback, and much more.</p>



<p>Ensure you always get an email address for free giveaways, as freebies can also help draw customers in to learn more about your company and then buy more in the future.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>Your to do task:</em></p>



<p>Consider what product(s) or content you can provide to your audience for free. Remember to continue engaging this audience long after they’ve received the freebie.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The coronavirus pandemic has brought a new challenge for the seafood industry &#8211; from fishermen to seafood processing to retail and restaurants. In a business that already has plenty of its own challenges, COVID-19 has already made plenty of commercial fishermen and seafood business owners wonder about their futures in the industry.</p>



<p>But it doesn’t have to be that way.&nbsp;</p>



<p>By adapting your business and exploring new, unique ways of offering products to your customers, you have the opportunity to not only survive in these trying times, but thrive.</p>



<h2><strong>3 WAYS YOUR SEAFOOD COMPANY CAN SUCCEED DURING COVID</strong></h2>



<h3><strong>1. Get creative with seafood service options.</strong></h3>



<p>Seafood restaurants and retail shops have a unique opportunity here: service customers in ways that you never have before.</p>



<p>Sure, takeout and delivery services are great options &#8211; especially if you’ve never offered them before. Curbside pickup is also an excellent way to keep your employees and customers safe.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="768" height="411" src="https://oscwebdesign.biz/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/seafood-service-options-marketing.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-3525" srcset="https://oscwebdesign.biz/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/seafood-service-options-marketing.jpg 768w, https://oscwebdesign.biz/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/seafood-service-options-marketing-300x161.jpg 300w, https://oscwebdesign.biz/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/seafood-service-options-marketing-600x321.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></figure>



<p>But how about some even more outside-the-box thinking? Consider packaging and selling meal kits for the week. With a predetermined menu, you can package meal kits &#8211; cooked or uncooked &#8211; for customers to take home and prepare or enjoy with their families. These types of kits can be established as a one-off or ongoing subscription basis for your customers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Think about taking this idea to the next level by incorporating great digital content alongside your kits. Video or written tutorials help customers prepare meals and entice new customers to purchase your cuisine.</p>



<h3><strong>2. Put digital marketing first.</strong></h3>



<p>It’s no surprise that those companies who have a great online marketing presence are going to have better success right now. No matter what your role in the seafood market, it’ll be instrumental that you position your business online to get in front of your target audience.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A few key areas include:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Website: </strong>Your website should be user friendly, crisp, clean, and help customers solve their problems. Any ecommerce or online store should be easy to navigate and secure for users.<br><br><em>Example: Your seafood shop’s ordering system should be simple and easy to use. Customers should be able to order what they need and check out securely without any issues.</em><br></li><li><strong>Blog, Video, Social Media &amp; Email Newsletters: </strong>No matter what form of content you choose to create, ensure that it’s reaching your target market. Give them the information and resources that adds value.<br><br><em>Example: Your seafood processing center can provide great resources on how your facility is keeping seafood safe and ready to ship to restaurants and retail shops.</em><strong><br></strong></li><li><strong>Google My Business: </strong>Local businesses have no choice but to focus on local demand. That starts with cleaning up your local search presence using Google My Business. Own your account information and ask happy customers to leave great reviews.<br><br><em>Example: Your fishing charter can use Google My Business to advertise existing discounts, share videos and photos from happy customers, and gain traction with fantastic reviews from customers.</em><br></li><li><strong>Google Analytics &amp; Google Search Console: </strong>You can’t manage what you don’t measure, so use these tools to measure all of your digital marketing efforts.</li></ul>



<h3><strong>3. Rethink your product distribution channels.</strong></h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="768" height="411" src="https://oscwebdesign.biz/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/seafood-product-distribution-marketing.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-3528" srcset="https://oscwebdesign.biz/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/seafood-product-distribution-marketing.jpg 768w, https://oscwebdesign.biz/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/seafood-product-distribution-marketing-300x161.jpg 300w, https://oscwebdesign.biz/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/seafood-product-distribution-marketing-600x321.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></figure>



<p>Now may not be the right time to recreate your business, but it is the perfect time to reimagine it. Consider your current customers and distribution channels&#8230;is this business structure sustainable in pandemic-riden times?&nbsp;</p>



<p>If not, think about how you can incorporate new distribution channels and customers quickly and effectively. For instance, if your seafood processing company traditionally supplies area restaurants with fresh seafood, how about providing product directly to customers?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Or if you are a commercial fishing company who sells your seafood to local restaurants, figure out what it would take to ship all across the country to a variety of different restaurant customers.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<p>No matter what, the pandemic has provided a perfect recipe for seeing what your seafood business is made of. Are you willing to pivot and last for the long haul? Or will you fold under the economic pressure? <strong>If you need help creating a digital marketing presence that represents your business and reaches your target market, </strong><a href="https://oscwebdesign.biz/contact-us/"><strong>contact us at AACHDEV</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>The post <a href="https://oscwebdesign.biz/how-your-seafood-company-can-still-succeed-during-the-coronavirus-pandemic/">How Your Seafood Company Can Still Succeed During the Coronavirus Pandemic</a> appeared first on <a href="https://oscwebdesign.biz">AACHDEV</a>.]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In our <a href="https://oscwebdesign.biz/times-you-should-hire-a-copywriter/">last article</a>, we covered a few instances in which you should hire a content writer for your business. If you’ve decided the time has come to hire a content writer, the next step is to find the <em>right</em> one.</p>



<p>Sure, there are a million “writers” with laptops and WIFI, but do you really want Joe Schmo representing your business… potentially all wrong?</p>



<h2>5 Kinds of Content Writers to Steer Clear Of</h2>



<h3>1. Long Winded</h3>



<p>More words are not always better.</p>



<p>Let me ask you this: Have you ever been trapped in a conversation with someone who’s long winded? At the first opportunity you made your escape, and that’s exactly how readers will feel when faced with a long winded page of content.</p>



<p>You should be on the lookout for a content writer who can get to the point.</p>



<h3>2. Inexperienced</h3>



<p>Oh they’ve written a few book reports for school? That’s swell, but doesn’t mean they’ll be the best content writer for your business.</p>



<p>Ask to see examples of their work &#8211; preferably already published online. Web content writing is very different from other forms of writing.</p>



<h3>3. Unadaptable</h3>



<p>The right content writer must have the ability to research a topic they’ve never seen before and become knowledgeable in it. Here at AACHDEV, we work with a wide range of businesses &#8211; from retirement homes to wholesale grocery eCommerce websites.</p>



<p>How much do you think our team really knew about the fluid sealing industry? Not a lot, but after working with Tri-State Packing we can explain it to anyone.</p>



<p>Being employed as a content writer is all about staying adaptable and willing to research your clients thoroughly.</p>



<h3>4. Conversion Unaware</h3>



<p>All effective content has an end goal driving it. If your content writer isn’t writing to <a href="https://oscwebdesign.biz/40-easy-tricks-maximize-conversion/">convert</a> readers, then your content isn’t acting as the valuable marketing material it should be! We always aim to prove our clients are field experts and a trustworthy solution in their niche.</p>



<h3>5. Search Engine Optimization Illiterate</h3>



<p>Besides converting your audience, content should help you reach them online. When you hire a content writer who’s well versed in SEO, your content will allow you to rank higher for specific search queries. Search engine optimization is actually one of the top reasons businesses want content to begin with.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Pay for #content that counts.&#8221; #qualitycontent</p></blockquote>



<h2>Where do I find the <em>right</em> content writer?</h2>



<p>If you’ve already established a relationship with a marketing or web design firm, ask them if they offer content writing services.</p>



<p>Content is the foundation of web marketing these days, and it can also be quite a bottleneck in the web design process. Because of these reasons, many marketing and web design firms have hired on professional copywriters.</p>



<p>Not only do we advise this route because <a href="https://oscwebdesign.biz/industries/">we offer search engine optimized content writing</a>, but the alternative is to scour freelancer websites or post a job on Craigslist. Finding a dependable and experienced content writer can be difficult, and your marketing firm will have already done the groundwork.</p>
