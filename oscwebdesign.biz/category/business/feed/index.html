										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a world that&#8217;s becoming increasingly automated, the good ol&#8217; days of warm and fuzzy human interactions are growing obsolete. There was a time (or so the legend goes) when shop owners would actually greet their customers by name. Now, it&#8217;s needless to set foot in a shop and customers often make purchase decisions without any human interaction.</p>



<p>Losing your brand&#8217;s human touch is a sad loss indeed – its main benefit is building trust and loyalty. Is there a way to turn back time and put the humanity back into your branding? Yes! Here&#8217;s how.</p>



<h2 id="h-interact-on-social-media">Interact on social media.</h2>



<p>Don&#8217;t just spew out posts – interact! Take a look at how one of our clients communicates with their audience. Even the language they use makes them feel relatable (and human) to their followers.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://instagram.com/beegoodbeverage"><img width="1024" height="1024" src="https://oscwebdesign.biz/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/11-1024x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-4237" srcset="https://oscwebdesign.biz/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/11-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https://oscwebdesign.biz/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/11-300x300.jpg 300w, https://oscwebdesign.biz/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/11-150x150.jpg 150w, https://oscwebdesign.biz/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/11-768x768.jpg 768w, https://oscwebdesign.biz/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/11-600x600.jpg 600w, https://oscwebdesign.biz/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/11-100x100.jpg 100w, https://oscwebdesign.biz/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/11.jpg 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><figcaption>Post from @beegoodbeverage</figcaption></figure>



<h2 id="h-post-photos">Post photos.</h2>



<p>Photos bring your brand to life. Give customers a look behind the scenes at your business through photos. These can be posted on <a href="https://oscwebdesign.biz/web-marketing/get-started-social-media-small-business/">social media</a>, in blogs, or incorporated right into your <a href="https://oscwebdesign.biz/features-best-modern-web-design/">web design</a>.</p>



<p>Our client Pine Tree Seafood, a Maine Seafood retailer, posts photos on social media that show just how much they love their jobs. Existing customers get to see behind the scenes to see the owner Jim filming a little video as an example.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="768" height="1024" src="https://oscwebdesign.biz/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/post-behind-the-scenes-photos-768x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-4238" srcset="https://oscwebdesign.biz/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/post-behind-the-scenes-photos-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://oscwebdesign.biz/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/post-behind-the-scenes-photos-225x300.jpg 225w, https://oscwebdesign.biz/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/post-behind-the-scenes-photos-1152x1536.jpg 1152w, https://oscwebdesign.biz/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/post-behind-the-scenes-photos-600x800.jpg 600w, https://oscwebdesign.biz/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/post-behind-the-scenes-photos.jpg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /><figcaption>Behind the scenes at Pine Tree Seafood during a recent video shoot.</figcaption></figure>



<h2 id="h-write-blogs">Write blogs.</h2>



<p>The benefits of blogging extend far past <a href="https://oscwebdesign.biz/services/maine-search-engine-optimization-seo/">SEO</a>. Publishing blog posts regularly to your website shows that your business is run by subject-matter experts and more importantly – humans. Don&#8217;t be afraid to give posts some voice and show the personality behind your business.</p>



<h2 id="h-tell-your-story">Tell your story.</h2>



<p>What made you decide to start your business? Did you overcome unique challenges? Emphasizing your brand&#8217;s roots helps your audience relate.<br>You can do this on your website&#8217;s homepage, about section, in an interview, blog post, and even in an advertisement.</p>



<h2 id="h-make-videos">Make videos.</h2>



<p>Step it up a notch from photos by making <a href="https://oscwebdesign.biz/youtube-optimization-3-ways-optimize-videos/">videos</a>. There&#8217;s no better way to show off the personalities of your staff members than with a video of them working, interacting with customers, or attending an event. If your business provides a complex service, create a video to explain it.</p>



<p>Below is a video that we produced for Pine Tree Seafood to showcase their retail location. The video was created for Facebook &amp; Instagram stories, hence the shortness, however we feel it&#8217;s a good way to get a quick feel of inside the store.</p>



<p></p>



<h2 id="h-have-fun-with-your-digital-marketing">Have fun with your digital marketing.</h2>



<p>When you have fun, it shows! Depending on your field and business, incorporating a playful twist in marketing content can go a long way.</p>



<p>The following example was used by <a href="https://mailchimp.com/" rel="nofollow">MailChimp</a> for customers sending out email campaigns. While it may be a bit too casual for some audiences, it&#8217;s spot on for theirs.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://oscwebdesign.biz/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/mailchimp-human-marketing.png" alt="Make Branding More Human" class="wp-image-3074"/></figure></div>



<h2 id="h-attend-events">Attend events.</h2>



<p>When all else fails – get boots on the ground! There are always events that encourage the participation of businesses like yours. Some of our favorites in Maine:</p>



<ul><li><a href="https://www.thinklocalusa.org/events/">Think Local Events</a>: Monthly networking events with local businesses, charities, and individuals.</li><li><a href="https://oscwebdesign.biz/business/maine-business-wordcamp-portland-2017/">WordCamp</a>: Held worldwide, WordCamps explore everything relating to popular open source website publishing platform, <a href="https://oscwebdesign.biz/create-pages-wordpress/">WordPress</a>. Even if your website isn&#8217;t with WordPress, you&#8217;ll find other topics informative like small business, marketing, development, and much more. Event in Maine hosted yearly.</li><li><a href="https://www.meetup.com/">MeetUps</a>: Search this handy website for MeetUps near you! A great place to make connections and (tactfully) hand out business cards.</li></ul>



<p>While these events are great places to start, it’s always best to look for ones specific to your industry. You may be surprised at the number of events a quick Google search will turn up.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When your business provides quotes to potential leads, it’s not always easy to get the phone ringing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You understand that it’s critical to have a conversation before providing a custom quote or an estimate for the job, but potential customers may have hesitation. Perhaps they are motivated by price or are doing an initial vendor comparison, but you know that getting them on the phone or having the sales meeting will prove you’re the best fit for the job.</p>



<h2><strong>The problem is: how do you get leads on the phone or in a meeting?</strong></h2>



<p>For many businesses, the secret is higher lead conversions on your website. But how do you go about that? How do you increase your online conversions when you provide custom quotes to potential customers? Read on to find out how.</p>



<h3><strong>1. SHOW YOUR EXPERTISE</strong></h3>



<p>One of the best ways to get potential customers interested in your services is by showing off your expertise. You’ll start to prove your value by showing your expertise.</p>



<p>There are multiple ways to do this, so choose the best option(s) for you!</p>



<ul><li><strong>Create consistent content:</strong> From blogging to video creation to social media to email marketing, there are a ton of fantastic ways to consistently reach your audience. Focus on creating quality content for your audience that they can put into practice. Once they realize that your service is too challenging to DIY, they’ll contact you to do the job for them!</li><li><strong>Give away free content: </strong>Similarly, create content with value for potential customers by packaging it in a way that both engages and keeps them interested in learning more. For instance, whitepapers, infographics, and downloadable freebies are excellent ways to share great content and (bonus!) you can put these downloads behind an email signup so that you consistently add to your email list.</li><li><strong>Create case studies: </strong>Case studies are an excellent way to help potential customers see the value in your work through story. Talk about different types of clients and the success they’ve had thanks to your valuable work. Include relevant statistics, numbers, and any data that will show how instrumental your services are.</li></ul>



<h3><strong>2. SHOWCASE TESTIMONIALS</strong></h3>



<p>Word of Mouth is still one of the most valuable marketing resources at your disposal. Referrals from trusted friends, family, or colleagues hold some of the biggest weight when given to potential leads.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="700" height="767" src="https://oscwebdesign.biz/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/customer-reviews.jpg" alt="Google Reviews for AACHDEV" class="wp-image-3876" srcset="https://oscwebdesign.biz/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/customer-reviews.jpg 700w, https://oscwebdesign.biz/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/customer-reviews-274x300.jpg 274w, https://oscwebdesign.biz/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/customer-reviews-600x657.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></figure>



<h4>Here are a couple of ways to leverage Word of Mouth for your business:&nbsp;</h4>



<ul><li><strong>Remind happy customers to refer:</strong> It’s more common for us to share a bad experience, rather than a great one. (In fact, it’s said that you’ll tell one person about a great experience you had, but you’ll tell ten people about a bad one!) Help happy customers help you by reminding them (with a quick note, email, or call) and ask if they have any referrals for you. You can even offer an incentive for this with a gift card or something similar!</li><li><strong>Ask for testimonials: </strong>The second best option to WOM? Online testimonials. Acquiring as many testimonials or referrals as you can will help potential customers see your success with previous clients. Showcase these testimonials on your website, Google My Business page, social media accounts, and even within your proposals.</li></ul>



<h3><strong>3. OFFER AN INCENTIVE</strong></h3>



<p>If you’re still struggling with getting more leads or more conversions from your online efforts, consider offering client incentives.</p>



<h4>Here are a few ideas to get you started:</h4>



<ul><li><strong>Seasonal incentives: </strong>Depending on your business, there may be opportunities for big incentives depending on the time of year. If your business slows down around the holidays/end of year, consider offering a 10% holiday discount to customers. Or, if you think your B2B customers will appreciate a tax season incentive, think about marketing your services around using tax refunds for your services. Think about your target audience and an incentive around the best time of year for them.</li><li><strong>Free sales calls: </strong>While many businesses we work with offer free sales calls to potential leads (especially when those businesses create custom quotes), it’s not always apparent. Keep potential leads moving forward by making it extremely clear that you offer free sales calls. This will help entice potential leads to fill out your contact form or pick up the phone and call, since there is no obligation.</li><li><strong>Give something away for free or a discount: </strong>Think of an easy and unique initial step that will help get leads in the door and on the way to becoming a customer. Many businesses may offer some type of audit to showcase what potential work can be done for customers. Things like audits can be offered complimentary or (more ideally) for a small fee. A small fee is actually more beneficial as it starts getting a customer invested in the opportunity to work with you.</li></ul>



<p>And there you have it! Three incredible ways to start improving conversions for your quotable business.&nbsp;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>While digital marketing is near and dear to our hearts here at OSC, we certainly aren&#8217;t blind to alternate avenues of marketing when they&#8217;re effective. Print marketing and magazine advertisements can allow businesses to increase brand exposure and reach new audiences.</p>



<p>If you&#8217;re ready to connect with potential customers you may not online, take care to observe the following dos and don&#8217;ts of eye-catching magazine advertisements.</p>



<h2>DO consider your branding.</h2>



<p>From colors to images, magazine advertisements are a great place to solidify and promote your brand. According to Brand Buddha, it takes an average of 5-7 impressions for someone to remember a brand. The more consistent you are across various channels, the better your odds are of sticking in your audience&#8217;s memory banks!</p>



<h2>DON&#8217;T make it all about you.</h2>



<p>You&#8217;re buying a magazine advertisement to market your company; shouldn&#8217;t it be about your brand and services? Yes&#8230; and no.</p>



<p>While content in the first option may be suitable for an <a href="https://oscwebdesign.biz/create-amazing-us-page-website/">about us page</a>, it&#8217;s not effective copy for a magazine advertisement. Put yourself in their shoes.</p>



<h2>DO use a Call-To-Action.</h2>



<p>For a magazine advertisement we&#8217;d recommend one, clear Call-To-Action. As you can see in the example above on the right side, our CTA is encouraging the reader to contact us. To learn more about <a href="https://oscwebdesign.biz/calls-action-cta-click/">CTAs</a>, check out this post.</p>



<h2>DON&#8217;T overwhelm them.</h2>



<p>Blank, white space helps to emphasize your magazine advertisement and keeps readers from becoming overwhelmed. From images to content, limit your ad to what&#8217;s most important.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Remember, <a href="https://oscwebdesign.biz/are-you-using-white-space-to-boost-ux-in-website-design/">white space</a> is your friend, not a waste.</p></blockquote>



<h2>DO mention that you&#8217;re local.</h2>



<p>Being a local business gives you a significant advantage over other non-local companies. Flaunt it in your magazine advertisement! Not only do customers place more trust in local businesses, but it also makes them feel good to support their community.</p>



<p>It can be as simple as adding a &#8216;We&#8217;re local!&#8217; badge to your ad.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<p>Get excited! Your next magazine advertisement will allow you to drum up more business or increase brand exposure at the very least. If you&#8217;d like assistance with the design and content for your ad, <a href="https://oscwebdesign.biz/contact-us/">our team is here to help</a>.</p>The post <a href="https://oscwebdesign.biz/magazine-advertisements-dos-donts/">Eye-Catching Magazine Advertisements: 4 Dos and Don’ts</a> appeared first on <a href="https://oscwebdesign.biz">AACHDEV</a>.]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>They cut down their prices yet again? Oh the nerve!</p>



<p>If you’ve been participating in a price slashing battle with competing businesses, we have good news for you: there’s another way. In fact there are 8 of them. It’s time to put your frustration to bed and compete with a superior strategy.</p>



<h2>1. Stand by your pricing and don’t give discounts.</h2>



<p>This says a lot about your service’s value and your business’s credibility. Notice how people generally don&#8217;t trust car dealers? They’re more worried about the deal others may have received vs. being content with the deal they did get. You can avoid this dilemma altogether by sticking to your guns.</p>



<h2>2. Post better photos on your website.</h2>



<p>Whether you’re hiring a hardscaper to build a patio or purchasing push pins on Amazon, chances are you want to see a clear representation of what you’ll receive. Find a friend with a camera, hire a local photographer, or ask your web designer (here at OSC, we have partnerships with local photographers who give discounted rates for our clients).</p>



<h2>3. Beat competitors in search engines.</h2>



<p>If you rank above your competitors’ websites in search engine results like Google, the battle may end there. Search engine optimization allows your website to begin rising above other results for specific search queries. Not ready to hire an <a href="https://oscwebdesign.biz/our-process/">SEO expert</a>? You can get started on SEO all by yourself with <a href="https://oscwebdesign.biz/seo-2017-beginners-guide-small-businesses/">articles like this</a>!</p>



<h2>4. Make doing business with you easier.</h2>



<p>Corporate giants spend piles of money trying to make purchases easier and it’s not hard to see why. We’re all busy (and/or lazy). Consumers can make huge purchases with just the click of a button now, why make them jump through hoops with forms and log ins?</p>



<h2>5. Display reviews and testimonials.</h2>



<p>A big reason why Amazon is so successful is their giant collection of <a href="https://oscwebdesign.biz/5-best-ways-get-customers-raving-brand/">customer reviews</a>. Consumers trust other consumers and would rather look at their feedback before making a purchase. If you have satisfied customers, ask them to provide you with a review!</p>



<h2>6. Write a better service/product description.</h2>



<p>Whenever there’s a question mark in a potential buyer’s mind, they typically don’t buy or take the time to ask. Why should they when there are so many options on the web? Avoid losing customers because of this by providing accurate and concise descriptions.</p>



<p>Another thing to remember is that potential customers don’t know every benefit of your product/service. This may seem like a no-brainer, but too often businesses neglect outlining key features. Perhaps competitors are making this blunder and that’s where you can swoop in. If you hate writing or lack the time, remember that content writing services are available.</p>



<h2>7. Use your brand to build value.</h2>



<p>Why is your business better than your competitors&#8217;? Use your reliable brand to justify pricing. Are you a seasoned company with decades of experience or a cutting edge start-up with fresh ideas?</p>



<p>With companies like Prada and Louis Vuitton, it’s pretty clear this strategy can work.</p>



<h2>8. Highlight what makes your business unique.</h2>



<p>Maybe you couldn’t tell your services/products apart from others in a line up, but there has to be something that sets you apart from competitors… your best asset may be right under your nose.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<p>Don’t waste another minute worrying about your competitors’ next price drop. Let them keep on devaluing their businesses, you can win with the previous approaches!</p>The post <a href="https://oscwebdesign.biz/ways-can-beat-competitors-without-slashing-prices/">8 Ways You Can Beat Competitors (Without Slashing Prices)</a> appeared first on <a href="https://oscwebdesign.biz">AACHDEV</a>.]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When you own a service based business, pricing your services can prove a surprisingly challenging feat. You don’t want to undervalue your services, but you don’t want to drive customers away either.</p>



<p>Over 20 years ago, the sugar industry came up with what they called “the sugar sweet spot”. This refers to the amount of sugar added to food and beverages that isn’t too much, isn’t too little &#8211; it’s <em>just right</em>.</p>



<p>They’ve obviously got it all figured it out, with sugar in almost everything. So what can we, as business owners, learn from the sugar industry in regard to pricing?</p>



<p>Here at AACHDEV, we think we’ve found the pricing sweet spot. Find it for your own business with these 3 tips!</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-price-services">How to Price Services</h2>



<h3 id="h-1-review-your-pricing-structure">1. Review your pricing structure.</h3>



<p>For many services, you will need to determine whether to charge by the hour or a flat fee. There are benefits as well as drawbacks for both options.</p>



<ul><li>Flat Fee</li></ul>



<p>Clients tend to prefer a flat fee over hourly. This frees them from worrying if you’re running behind schedule and racking up a bill. At the same time, there’s a chance they’ll balk at a larger (but realistic) price tag.</p>



<ul><li>Hourly</li></ul>



<p>Choosing hourly is safer for you and means you’ll never be stuck working for free. If you inaccurately estimate how long a project will take you, be prepared to likely face an upset customer.</p>



<p>Want to compare an hourly rate to salary? Check out this <a href="http://www.convertunits.com/hourly/" rel="nofollow">salary calculator</a>.</p>



<ul><li>Combination</li></ul>



<p>Perhaps you hire labor under you. You may want to consider charging a flat fee for your services (the expert) and charging hourly for their part in the project.</p>



<h3 id="h-2-look-at-the-competition">2. Look at the competition.</h3>



<p>With practically every business up on the web, it’s usually not hard to track down your competitors’ prices. While you don’t want to get into a back and forth pricing battle, you need to be in the same ball park.</p>



<p>After you’ve determined you’re in range, look for areas to set your business apart. Own a <a href="https://oscwebdesign.biz/tips-best-landscaping-website/">landscaping business</a>? Sometimes saying “we can customize services to fit your needs” is too vague. Put together unique package options for them.</p>



<p>If your competition doesn’t list a price anywhere, this may be just as frustrating for potential customers as it is for you. Dispel the mystery and make your business the obvious choice by listing prices clearly on your website.</p>



<h3 id="h-3-cost-plus-pricing">3. Cost-Plus Pricing</h3>



<p>It’s always wise to have a good idea of your expenses anyway. To determine your services’s cost, you need to consider fixed costs, direct costs, and indirect costs.</p>



<p>Some commonly overlooked expenses:</p>



<ul><li>Insurance</li><li>Employees and benefits</li><li>Training employees</li><li>Equipment and updates</li><li>Permits</li><li>Payment delays</li></ul>



<p>After you’ve added up all of your expenses, divide that by the number of jobs you expect to undertake, add on your profit, and voila &#8211; you have a service price.</p>

<p>The room was buzzing with the energy and chatter of local businesses. Since becoming a member in May of 2017, here at OSC we&#8217;ve already witnessed&nbsp;the value of Think Local first hand. This organization allows individuals and businesses to build relationships through various events and weekly chapter meetings.</p>



<p>Jeff Ball, Executive Director, has the perfect attitude&nbsp;for organizing Think Local. He is both outgoing and welcoming and truly made Think Local&#8217;s 8th anniversary a success!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Some came for the people, some came for the glorious Holy Donuts&#8230; We all attended <a href="https://portlandme.wordcamp.org/2017/">WordCamp Portland, ME 2017</a> for the heap of new ideas and education centered around WordPress.</p>



<p>Here at AACHDEV, we’re proud to have sponsored our second year of WordCamp in Maine. Although we weren’t able to catch every session (someone had to chaperone our photo booth) each talk we saw had a number of useful takeaways.</p>



<p>We’ve compiled a few of our top highlights and photos!</p>



<h2>Keynote Speaker: K. Adam White</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignnone"><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DA2jYK8VwAArA_K.jpg:large" alt=""/><figcaption>Photo credit <a href="https://twitter.com/jeffgolenski">@jeffgolenski</a></figcaption></figure>



<p>K. Adam White, Senior Engineer at <a href="https://bocoup.com/">Bocoup</a>, was this year’s keynote speaker at #wcpwm17. He turned coding into something inspirational with his talk ‘Democratizing Software’,&nbsp;emphasizing that <i>everyone</i> can learn how to code.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">“We’re all human. We’re all born, we all die.<br>None of us start out knowing how to code.” <a href="https://twitter.com/kadamwhite">@kadamwhite</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/wcpwm17?src=hash">#wcpwm17</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/wordpress?src=hash">#wordpress</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/wordcamp?src=hash">#wordcamp</a></p><p>— Jesse Fowler (@OSC_WebDesign) <a href="https://twitter.com/OSC_WebDesign/status/868526858773680128">May 27, 2017</a></p></blockquote>

<p><strong>Takeaway:</strong>&nbsp;Everyone can learn code!</p>



<h2>‘How to Double Your WordPress Site Conversions&#8230; Easily’</h2>

<p>This guy knows how to make an impression. Tom Shapiro, CEO of <a href="http://www.stratabe.at/">Stratabeat</a>, was an exceptional speaker with infectious energy.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote twitter-tweet align"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Big thanks to all attendees at my <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/wcpwm17?src=hash">#wcpwm17</a> session on conversion optimization! You can download the slides here: <a href="https://t.co/VjBHpSfpK4">https://t.co/VjBHpSfpK4</a></p><p>— Tom Shapiro (@TomShapiro) <a href="https://twitter.com/TomShapiro/status/868590908069089281">May 27, 2017</a></p></blockquote>



<p><script async="" src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>



<p><strong>Takeaways:</strong></p>



<ul><li>As businesses, we’ll often forget to focus on ‘What’s in it for them?’ in regard to website content. Don’t just explain what you do, explain how your audience will&nbsp;be benefited.</li><li>What makes you different from other brands? Emphasize that.</li><li>Get insight on user behavior with scroll mapping, heat mapping, session recordings and more.</li><li>Take another look at your <a href="/web-marketing/calls-action-cta-click/">calls-to-action</a> and be certain you’re using them strategically.</li><li>Aim to evoke an emotional response with your website and calls-to-action.</li><li>So much more! This talk was chock full of useful conversion tips. We encourage you to take a look at the link to Tom’s slides above.</li></ul>



<h2>‘Busting Through the Content Bottleneck: How to Efficiently Collect Content From Your Clients or Colleagues’</h2>



<p>As a web design agency, we’ve run into the same problem that many others encounter: content collection holds up projects. Our clients are typically business owners who are experts in their niche, but are not necessarily writers. Other times it’s not about the writing and it’s all about a lack of time.</p>



<p>Andy McIlwain (content creator at GoDaddy, check out <a href="https://www.godaddy.com/garage/webpro/design/how-osc-web-design-found-its-niche/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">his article on us here</a>) shared how to put an end to this bottleneck and collect content efficiently. His slides were also made available.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote twitter-tweet"><p>Busting Through the Content Bottleneck: WordCamp Portland, Maine 2017 <a href="https://t.co/irXkqijWbf">https://t.co/irXkqijWbf</a> <a href="https://t.co/bY1mYJtHHc">pic.twitter.com/bY1mYJtHHc</a></p><p><script async="" src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8">&amp;lt;/p></script></p><cite>Andy McIlwain (@andymci) <a href="https://twitter.com/andymci/status/868391638003060736">May 27, 2017</a></cite></blockquote>



<p><strong>Takeaways:</strong></p>



<ul><li>Your clients (or colleagues) need your help to deal with website content.</li><li>Offering a content creation service opens up a new area of opportunities.</li><li>Andy offered three solutions to the content bottleneck:<br>1. Content as an up-front dependency (no content, no project).<br>2. Content as an early project phase (move content to the start of the project).<br>3. Working on content in tandem with website design and development (put in tandem with website design and development).</li></ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you think local and cheap resources for Maine businesses are nonexistent, it’s only because you haven’t yet looked in the right places! We’ve compiled 6 of our very favorite.</p>



<h2>1. Meetups</h2>



<p>Meetups are great opportunities to network with other Maine businesses, learn, and share. Whether your interests lie in Russian culture or urban farm foraging.. There’s a Meetup in Maine for you!</p>



<p>Here at OSC, we’re frequent attendees at the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Southern-Maine-WordPress-Meetup/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Southern Maine WordPress Meetup</a> in Westbrook, Maine. This Meetup features presentations and discussions on all things WordPress.</p>



<p>With WordPress now powering over <a href="https://w3techs.com/technologies" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">28% of all websites</a>, it’s a valuable tool for businesses of all sizes. Whatever question you may have regarding your website, someone at the Southern Maine WordPress Meetup will probably have an answer.</p>



<h2>2. Buy Local Groups</h2>



<p>If your business is based in Maine, chances are that there’s a Buy Local group in your city. Getting involved will not only allow you to network and support local businesses, it will also land you with benefits such as:</p>



<ul><li>Voting in local decisions.</li><li>Getting your business, description, and website listed in their online directory (think <a href="https://oscwebdesign.biz/rank-higher-local-search-engine-results/">local SEO</a>!).</li><li>Participate in member-only local events.</li><li>Bragging rights.</li></ul>



<p>Are you based in Scarborough, Maine like us? Consider joining <a href="http://www.scarboroughbuylocal.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Scarborough Buy Local</a>!</p>



<h2>3. MaineToday Calendar</h2>



<p>MaineToday is a truly useful resource for keeping up with all things Maine. <a href="http://calendar.mainetoday.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Their calendar</a> lists a large number of statewide events and you can filter by category.</p>



<p>By selecting ‘business’, you can take your pick from low-cost and no-cost opportunities. This month includes a QuickBooks workshop for small businesses and an eCommerce webinar.</p>



<h2>4. Job Fairs</h2>



<p>Finding dependable employees can sometimes prove difficult.. Job fairs make the process easier for both employers and employees.</p>



<p>Just by meeting applicants face-to-face, you can already determine a few things:</p>



<ul><li>They’re motivated enough to attend.</li><li>They know how to dress appropriately.</li><li>They’re sociable.</li><li>They likely have dependable transportation.</li></ul>



<p>..all without scheduling (often inconvenient) individual interviews. In most cases these events are free for both parties, take a look at upcoming <a href="http://www.mainecareercenter.gov/employment/jobfairs.shtml">Maine job fairs here</a>.</p>



<h2>5. WordCamp Portland, ME</h2>



<p>Put on yearly by volunteers at local tech companies, WordCamp Portland, ME is centered around all things WordPress. WordPress is an open source website creation tool and one of the most popular platforms in the world.</p>



<p>Even if your business’s website is not built on WordPress, there will probably be something of value for you at this event. Talks are on marketing, web development, and entrepreneurship &#8211; for beginners and experts alike. Tickets usually range from $10-$30, a steal considering all the perks they include.</p>



<p>Be on the lookout for <a href="https://www.facebook.com/WordCampPortlandME/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WordCamp Portland, ME 2018</a>!</p>



<h2>6. Maine Business Leadership Network</h2>

<ul><li>A network of businesses to share information on disability employment.</li><li>Business resources and forums on best practices and workforce solutions that increase diversity.</li><li>Partnerships with businesses, government, and people with disabilities.</li></ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Maine is one of our favorite places in the world, but let’s admit it &#8211; owning and growing a Maine business can be tough. Resources are few and far between, and this includes local opportunities to share new skills.</p>
<p>What if we were to tell you there’s an amazing resource that’s passed right under your radar each year? They&#8217;re called WordCamps.</p>
<h2>What is a WordCamp?</h2>
<p>WordCamps are business conferences with a twist. They are fun, friendly, and low-key.</p>
<p>Each WordCamp (they are held all over the world) focuses on a variety of WordPress related topics. WordPress is an open source blogging and content management system used to create <a href="https://w3techs.com/" rel="nofollow">27% of websites</a>. What makes WordPress unique, is that it’s a community-driven project with world wide contributors.</p>
<h2>It’s not just for geeks.</h2>
<p>You may be wondering why you, a business owner, would want to attend a conference hosted by an online publishing platform. The name ‘WordCamp’ admittedly sounds a bit nerdy.. Nevertheless, you don’t have to be fluent in <a href="https://oscwebdesign.biz/inbound-marketing/essential-geek-glossary-web-design-marketing-part-12/">geek speak</a> or be a web developer to find value.</p>
<p>Passing through the crowds at WordCamp in Portland, you’ll find a mixed bag of attendees. There are advanced coders with decades of experience chatting with week-old entrepreneurs working to launch their first website.</p>
<p>Topics that are generally covered:</p>

<h2>Keeps you in-the-know.</h2>
<p>Although talks usually fall into the same broad categories, they are unique each year. As business, marketing, and the web advance, talks continue to evolve.</p>
<p>It’s a challenge to stay at the forefront of everything in your own niche, let alone a number of others. WordCamps give you a taste of what’s new and important to people.</p>
<h2>Ask questions and network.</h2>
<p>Have a question regarding the web and websites? There will more than likely be someone present who can give you an answer. Chat with Maine web designers and marketers before hiring anonymous firms online.</p>
<p>Business networking events tend to be limited in Maine, so if you want to shake hands and pass out business cards &#8211; this is your chance!</p>
<h2>Cheap!</h2>
<p>Need one last convincing reason to show up at WordCamp Portland, ME 2017? Tickets are CHEAP! Ten bucks kind of cheap. You’ll get education, a chance to network, and freebies galore starting at just ten dollars a ticket.</p>
<p>This year’s event will take place at MECA (Maine College of Art) in Portland, Maine on May 26th and 27th. Check out the details on <a href="https://2017.portlandme.wordcamp.org/" rel="nofollow">their website</a> and grab tickets before they’re gone!

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There I was, staring down at Philadelphia from a plane on my way home to a colder state. The past few days were a whirlwind of fun, meeting people and learning about how others do business in this industry.</p>
<p>I wanted to take a moment to write down some of the highlights for myself and pass it along to others. If you’ve read my <a href="https://oscwebdesign.biz/jesses-corner/all-that-is-great-about-wordcamps-wcme16-wrap-up/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">post on why WordCamps are what is right with the world</a> &#8211; you know what WCUS means to me &#8211; if not, you should check it out.</p>
<h3>So what is <a href="”https://twitter.com/search?q=%23WCUS”" rel="”nofollow”">#WCUS</a> &#8211; or <a href="https://2016.us.wordcamp.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">WordCamp US</a>?</h3>
<p>It’s a geek carnival of sorts. It’s where almost 1,900 computer geeks (self proclaimed by the way) get together in one place to learn what others are doing, see how to optimize their own workflow, learn about new products and drink a healthy amount of alcohol at the after parties.</p>
<p>There are talks about security, REST API, design, content and SO much more. If you are a beginner &#8211; WordCamps are for you. If you are a pro &#8211; WordCamps are for you. It’s all inclusive and tickets are only $40 &#8211; not too bad considering the value you get.</p>
<p>So let’s break it down a little bit more. If you have read my post on WordCamps in the past, then you know it’s all about meeting people and making connections. My personal goal at every WC is to meet 3 new people and make lasting connections. At WCUS I was able to far exceed that number and it’s absolutely wonderful.</p>
<p><figure id="attachment_3840" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3840" style="width: 1140px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-3840" src="https://oscwebdesign.biz/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/godaddy-managewp-crew-wcus16.jpg" alt="GoDaddy &amp; ManageWP Crew at WCUS 2016" width="1140" height="447" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-3840" class="wp-caption-text">The whole GoDaddy &amp; ManageWP crew at WordCamp US 2016.</figcaption></figure></p>
<p>As you may know, I was sent along by the <a href="https://godaddy.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">great people at GoDaddy</a> to be an evangelist of sorts. I’m an avid user of GoDaddy products, so it’s really a natural fit for me. I mention this as a disclaimer, but also to explain that I was able to connect with the whole crew from <a href="https://managewp.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">ManageWP</a>.</p>
<p><figure id="attachment_3833" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3833" style="width: 1140px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-3833 size-full" src="https://oscwebdesign.biz/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/wcus-hall-pre-game.jpg" alt="Sponsor Hall Setup WCUS" width="1140" height="708" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-3833" class="wp-caption-text">Sponsor Hall Setup WCUS 2016</figcaption></figure></p>
<p>Let me tell you, these guys and gals are amazing. They really know their stuff and are excited to help anyone and everyone. Their job at WCUS was to simply enjoy the event, but they were dying to show how the product could help people and even organized a live demo.</p>
<p>Needless to say, I signed up on the spot (because it’s free with my GoDaddy hosting) and am already seeing the benefits. Again, this isn’t an ad for them &#8211; it’s simply the truth. I can’t even name the whole team as there were at least 7 people from ManageWP, but I was able to make a connection with every single one of them.</p>
<p><figure id="attachment_3848" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3848" style="width: 1140px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-3848" src="https://oscwebdesign.biz/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/media-temple-wcus-16.jpg" alt="Media Temple setup at WCUS" width="1140" height="641" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-3848" class="wp-caption-text">Media Temple setup at WCUS &#8211; great job!</figcaption></figure></p>
<p>Let’s move on to others now, shall we? I was able to do a small interview with <a href="https://twitter.com/LoganKipp" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Logan</a> at <a href="https://www.sitelock.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">SiteLock</a> &#8211; another program I am going to sign up for and try out &#8211; which was a blast. I can’t wait to see that one when it’s all edited and will make sure I add the link in when it’s available.</p>
<p><figure id="attachment_3837" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3837" style="width: 350px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-3837 size-full" src="https://oscwebdesign.biz/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/media-temple-win.jpg" alt="Beats Headphones from Media Temple" width="350" height="350" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-3837" class="wp-caption-text">Won these awesome urbeats headphones from Media Temple!</figcaption></figure></p>
<p>I also connected with <a href="https://twitter.com/freelilly" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Lilly</a> over at <a href="https://mediatemple.net/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Media Temple</a> and took home some of their amazing swag. Although GoDaddy managed hosting works for 99% of my clients, I will definitely be trying out the Media Temple services and running tests to see how it works for me. I even won some great swag from them, which I quite enjoyed having on the plane ride home!</p>
<p>I met countless web design companies that were eager to share their secrets. Yes, you read that right &#8211; they shared their secrets. That’s why I love this community so much. There is enough tide to float all boats, right? We work together for the greater good.</p>
<p>We are in business to make money, there is no doubt about that, but there is enough traffic and business out there for all of us&#8230; Why not work together to grow better companies who can all succeed? In fact, one of the companies employs mainly (if not all) US Veterans as a way to give back &#8211; how cool is that?</p>
<h3>What’s WCUS like? Why should I go?</h3>
<p>As mentioned, I was sponsored to attend, so my point of view may be slightly different than others.</p>
<p>I arrived on Thursday, dropped off my stuff at the hotel, and went straight over to the venue to “help” setup. I say “help” because the whole ManageWP crew was there organizing away. If they are this good at organizing swag, I can’t imagine how great their coding organizational skills are.</p>
<p>The sponsor hall was filled with boxes and people running around setting up booths to prepare for the masses that following morning. After the booth was good to go, we all got together and hit up a local bar.</p>
<p>As a rule, you are not allowed to go a night without drinks. That might be a protocol somewhere &#8211; or maybe that’s just how I visit the camps. This was a great opportunity to talk to some who I had just met and also catch up with friends made last year. Then it was off to bed with lots of water in an attempt to recover before morning.</p>
<h3>Get up &#8211; grab swag &#8211; meet amazing people.</h3>
<p>At around 8 AM, we arrived at the venue to finalize our setup &#8211; which consisted of getting out some amazing pins. The pins were designed by <a href="https://twitter.com/marktimemedia" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Michelle Schulp</a> who also designed the <a href="https://ifyouwillit.com/business/wordpress/the-story-behind-the-wordcamp-us-godaddy-coins/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">killer coins for GoDaddy at WordCamp US 2015</a>.</p>
<p>These pins were sure to spark some discussion and that they did. As soon as people came in, they began grabbing them, trading them online and discussing the latest products with us. At times I’d sneak away to chat with other vendors and attendees.</p>
<p><figure id="attachment_3849" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3849" style="width: 1140px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-3849" src="https://oscwebdesign.biz/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/sponsor-hall-full-of-people-wcus.jpg" alt="Sponsor Hall at WCUS 16 full of people" width="1140" height="424" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-3849" class="wp-caption-text">Sponsor Hall at WCUS 16 full of people!</figcaption></figure></p>
<div class="clear"></div>
<p><figure id="attachment_3832" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3832" style="width: 350px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-3832 size-full" src="https://oscwebdesign.biz/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/wcus-band.jpg" alt="Band playing during lunch at WCUS" width="350" height="376" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-3832" class="wp-caption-text">Some great music during lunch at WCUS</figcaption></figure></p>
<p>This continued for a few hours before I was able to grab lunch. WCUS did it again with a great band playing for our entertainment &#8211; I believe it was actually the same local band as last year. The music reminded you of where you were and why Philadelphia was such a great location for the event.</p>
<p>As the day winded down, we refreshed at the hotel and headed over to the GoDaddy after party. Oh my &#8211; how many people can you fit into an awesome little two story restaurant? Well, I think we found out.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><figure id="attachment_3847" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3847" style="width: 1140px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-3847 size-full" src="https://oscwebdesign.biz/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/godaddy-after-party.jpg" alt="GoDaddy after party at WCUS" width="1140" height="760" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-3847" class="wp-caption-text">The GoDaddy after party.

<p><figure id="attachment_3846" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3846" style="width: 350px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-3846 size-full" src="https://oscwebdesign.biz/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/mendel-godaddy-after-party-wcus.jpg" alt="Mendel Kurland at the GoDaddy After Party" width="350" height="233" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-3846" class="wp-caption-text">Mendel gives us a speech during the GoDaddy after party. Photo credit Brian Krogsgard &#8211; @Krogsgard</figcaption></figure></p>
<p>It was the place to be to kick off the night and did not disappoint. The food was on point, the talk by <a href="https://twitter.com/ifyouwillit" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Mendel</a> and Vladimir showcased why the partnership between ManageWP and GoDaddy would be a perfect fit, and again &#8211; the connections! You don’t go to an after party like this without running into the who’s who of this industry.</p>
<p>From there we hopped over and crashed the Media Temple party &#8211; another one that tested a restaurant’s maximum capacity.</p>
<h3>Go home. Rest. Day Two.</h3>
<p>Day two was just as great as day one for WordCamp US. I was able to spend a little more one-on-one time with attendees and discuss the issues some were facing to provide solutions &#8211; or at least direct them to the right person.</p>
<p>I approach these issues from a slightly different angle than some because I’ve been there, I’ve encountered the same problems, and in time have overcome them. I wasn’t simply trying to push product on someone, but rather help them find the solution to best fit their needs.</p>
<p>The best part of WCUS is when there was a question I wasn’t able to answer, I simply pointed my finger and said ‘he/she is the person you really want to talk to’. Where else do you get to do that? The day went off without a hitch and closed with another great talk by Matt Mullenweg on the yearly State of the Word.</p>
<p><figure id="attachment_3839" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3839" style="width: 1140px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-3839" src="https://oscwebdesign.biz/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/state-of-the-word-wcus16.jpg" alt="State of the Word WCUS 2016" width="1140" height="586" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-3839" class="wp-caption-text">State of the word with Matt Mullenweg. Photo credit Mendel Kurland @ifyouwillit</figcaption></figure></p>
<p>Where would we go? What’s next? Last year he directed us to learn JavaScript deeply &#8211; and we tried. We’re still doing our part to get better, and there are improvements to be made, but we are headed in the right direction as a community.</p>
<p>Matt (yeah, I’m going first name like we’re buds) announced that the WordPress foundation will support <a href="https://twitter.com/hackthehood" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">HackTheHood</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/internetarchive" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">InternetArchive</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/BlackGirlsCode" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">BlackGirlsCode</a> &#8211; which is an awesome direction to head. WordPress and the community is vast and should always be inclusive of everyone.</p>
<p>Positive steps like these make me excited to be part of the WordPress community and its movement! Although I can’t go into every detail of what Matt talked about &#8211; there IS a blog post on just this, check out the <a href="https://poststatus.com/matt-mullenweg-state-word-2016/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">State of the Word post from Post Status</a>.</p>
<h3>Can you say ‘Most amazing after party ever?’ We just did.</h3>
<p><figure id="attachment_3834" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3834" style="width: 1140px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-3834 size-full" src="https://oscwebdesign.biz/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/wcus-after-party-outside.jpg" alt="WCUS After Party - Outside" width="1140" height="537" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-3834" class="wp-caption-text">Outside of the WCUS After Party</figcaption></figure></p>
<p>The party was to take place at the <a href="http://www.ansp.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Academy of Natural Sciences</a>. I think I can speak for everyone in saying it exceeded our expectations.</p>
<p>Normally the after party would be at a large bar or somewhere else to mingle and get a few drinks. This was an experience like no other, however. Sip a drink and munch on apps in the shadow of a reconstructed T-Rex!</p>
<p>Just when you thought you’ve seen everything, you end up in the auditorium &#8211; where there is karaoke. Now I’m not sure if you know the sort of people we are dealing with here. If I can generalize for just a moment, the majority of the 1,900 people at WCUS are introverts. We like people, but we’re not an overly social crowd. Watching others get up stage and have a blast was an amazing touch. When else can you sing karaoke… in a museum… with dinosaurs… ? I mean, come on &#8211; that’s just one for the books. Huge congrats to all that had the courage to get on stage and have a great time.</p>
<p><figure id="attachment_3835" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3835" style="width: 1140px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-3835 size-full" src="https://oscwebdesign.biz/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/wcus-afterparty-inside.jpg" alt="WCUS After Party Inside" width="1140" height="438" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-3835" class="wp-caption-text">Inside the WCUS after party &#8211; Amazing!</figcaption></figure></p>
<h3>Contributor day &#8211; giving back to the community.</h3>
<p><figure id="attachment_3838" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3838" style="width: 1140px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-3838" src="https://oscwebdesign.biz/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/wcus-contributor-day.jpg" alt="Contributor Day at WCUS 16" width="1140" height="605" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-3838" class="wp-caption-text">Great picture of the translation contributors from Milan Ivanović &#8211; @lanche86</figcaption></figure></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-3836" src="https://oscwebdesign.biz/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/independence-hall-philadelphia.jpg" alt="Independence Hall in Philadelphia" width="350" height="486" />Many people were able to make it back for Sunday’s contributor day and work on different parts of WordPress to give back.</p>
<p>Since there are so many visiting from other countries, what better time to work on the translation aspects? What happens when this is combined with a ton of high end developers? Work on the code! This was such a great opportunity and good part of the event.</p>
<p>I won’t lie, however &#8211; I had to catch a flight so I was only able to pop in for a short period of time. I wanted to see a little bit more of what Philadelphia has to offer &#8211; there is so much history here after all. I was able to sneak away to Independence Hall and stand in the room where the Declaration of Independence was signed.</p>
<p>The feeling that rushes over you in that room is just insane. You can practically feel the heritage of our country in the air and it made me wish I could have been a fly on the wall back in the day. I can’t wait to bring my daughter back in a year or two to walk with her through it.</p>
<h3 class="clear">Then &#8211; we fly home.</h3>
<p>This is the time when the WordCamp high starts to wear off. This is when we reflect on the whirlwind of what happened and the people we met. I know it’s a great opportunity for myself and I’m forever grateful to a few people in particular.</p>
<p><figure id="attachment_3841" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3841" style="width: 350px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-3841 size-full" src="https://oscwebdesign.biz/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/pan-selfie.jpg" alt="Fun at WCUS16" width="350" height="263" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-3841" class="wp-caption-text">Noah, Nevena &amp; Isaac doing the pan selfie!
