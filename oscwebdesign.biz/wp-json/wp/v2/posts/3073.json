Give customers a look behind the scenes at your business through photos. These can be posted on <a href=\"https:\/\/oscwebdesign.biz\/web-marketing\/get-started-social-media-small-business\/\">social media<\/a>, in blogs, or incorporated right into your <a href=\"https:\/\/oscwebdesign.biz\/features-best-modern-web-design\/\">web design<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our client Pine Tree Seafood, a Maine Seafood retailer, posts photos on social media that show just how much they love their jobs.

Publishing blog posts regularly to your website shows that your business is run by subject-matter experts and more importantly \u2013 humans. Don&#8217;t be afraid to give posts some voice and show the personality behind your business.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-tell-your-story\">Tell your story.<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>What made you decide to start your business? Did you overcome unique challenges? Emphasizing your brand&#8217;s roots helps your audience relate.<br>You can do this on your website&#8217;s homepage, about section, in an interview, blog post, and even in an advertisement.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-make-videos\">Make videos.<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Step it up a notch from photos by making <a href=\"https:\/\/oscwebdesign.biz\/youtube-optimization-3-ways-optimize-videos\/\">videos<\/a>. There&#8217;s no better way to show off the personalities of your staff members than with a video of them working, interacting with customers, or attending an event. If your business provides a complex service, create a video to explain it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Below is a video that we produced for Pine Tree Seafood to showcase their retail location. The video was created for Facebook &amp; Instagram stories, hence the shortness, however we feel it&#8217;s a good way to get a quick feel of inside the store.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-have-fun-with-your-digital-marketing\">Have fun with your digital marketing.<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When you have fun, it shows! Depending on your field and business, incorporating a playful twist in marketing content can go a long way.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The following example was used by <a href=\"https:\/\/mailchimp.com\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">MailChimp<\/a> for customers sending out email campaigns. While it may be a bit too casual for some audiences, it&#8217;s spot on for theirs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img src=\"https:\/\/oscwebdesign.biz\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/11\/mailchimp-human-marketing.png\" alt=\"Make Branding More Human\" class=\"wp-image-3074\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-attend-events\">Attend events.<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When all else fails \u2013 get boots on the ground!
