Perceptual set theory is a notion defined by F.H. Allport in 1955 as:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>\u2018A perceptual bias or predisposition or readiness to perceive particular features of a stimulus.\u2019<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>In other words, the brain has a tendency to consider some aspects of what is presented to it, and ignore others. Which are considered and which are ignored is determined by the following factors:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>\u2022 Expectations<\/strong><br><strong> \u2022 Emotion<\/strong><br><strong> \u2022 Motivation<\/strong><br><strong> \u2022 Culture<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If this isn\u2019t sounding very clear to you, take a look at these visual examples of perceptual set theory given in 1955 by Bruner and Minturn.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/oscwebdesign.biz\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/12\/call-to-action-perceptual-set-theory-1.png\"><img src=\"https:\/\/oscwebdesign.biz\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/12\/call-to-action-perceptual-set-theory-1.png\" alt=\"cta perceptual theory\" class=\"wp-image-3962\"\/><\/a><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>What\u2019s that character in the middle? If you\u2019re like most people, you\u2019d probably say it\u2019s the number &#8217;13&#8217;.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/oscwebdesign.biz\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/12\/call-to-action-perceptual-set-theory-2.png\"><img src=\"https:\/\/oscwebdesign.biz\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/12\/call-to-action-perceptual-set-theory-2.png\" alt=\"cta perceptual theory example\" class=\"wp-image-3963\"\/><\/a><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>Now what does it look like? A lot more like the letter &#8216;B&#8217; right? The first example prepared us for the possibility of another number, while the second did not. We were biased towards expecting a letter because of what was around it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What This Means for Calls-to-Action<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We\u2019ve been conditioned by past experiences (<strong>culture<\/strong>) to anticipate (<strong>expectation<\/strong>) that the CTA is coming.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignright\"><a href=\"https:\/\/oscwebdesign.biz\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/12\/call-to-action-button.png\"><img src=\"https:\/\/oscwebdesign.biz\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/12\/call-to-action-button.png\" alt=\"CTA example\" class=\"wp-image-3964\"\/><\/a><figcaption>Call-to-Action from the Neil Patel site.<\/figcaption><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>When users are brought to your website\u2019s landing page and read through what your content offer\/service\/product will include, their anticipation is building.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>They know that at the right time, like the peak in a story line, they will be presented with the CTA.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As humans, finding exactly what we expected is delightful. What can be more satisfying than confirmation that we are right?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh yeah, pressing buttons.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>You never grow out of the childish satisfaction of pressing a button. #CTA #calltoaction #convert #marketing tips via <\/p><cite>@osc_webdesign<\/cite><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h2>Enable Users to Feel Accomplished<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s the little things. Not many people can say they\u2019ve won a gold medal in the olympics or fed a nation of starving children, but the instant gratification of pressing a button allows us to feel accomplished.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You built up to your Call-to-Action enough to create a kind of mystery and value, now users want it unveiled. They have the <strong>motivation<\/strong> to click it, and they anticipate the <strong>emotional<\/strong> reward they have in store.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"\/>\n\n\n\n<p>Don\u2019t leave your website users with a cliffhanger.
